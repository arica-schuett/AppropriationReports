                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach,

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

        Department the Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain

        section 229.''.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

        Department the Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

            Sincerely,
                                         Phillip L. Swagel,
                                                          Director.
    Enclosure.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 7675, a bill to 
amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 
to establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for other

            Sincerely,
                                         Phillip L. Swagel,
                                                          Director.
    Enclosure.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 7675, a bill to 
amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 
to establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for other 
purposes.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Tiffany 
Arthur.
            Sincerely,
                                         Phillip L. Swagel,
                                                          Director.
    Enclosure.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                   Constitutional Authority Statement

    The Committee finds the Constitutional authority for this

Congress the authority to regulate foreign and interstate 
commerce.

                    Performance Goals and Objectives

    Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the House of 
Representatives, the performance goals and objectives of this 
measure are to strengthen the agriculture and food system 
supply chain and reduce the associated costs of supply chain 
disruptions for American farmers, ranchers, and consumers.

                        Committee Cost Estimate

    Pursuant to clause 3(d)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the Committee report incorporates the 
cost estimate prepared by the Director of the Congressional 
Budget Office pursuant to sections 402 and 423 of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974.

                      Advisory Committee Statement

    No advisory committee within the meaning of section 5(b) of 
the Federal Advisory Committee Act was created by this

104-1).

                       Federal Mandates Statement

    This measure does not contain any congressional earmarks, 
limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined in 
clause 9(e), 9(f), or 9(g) of rule XXI of the House of 
Representatives.

                    Duplication of Federal Programs

the Federal Government known to be duplicative of another 
Federal program, a program that was included in any report from 
Government Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to 
section 21 of Public Law 111-139, or a program related to a 
program in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic 
Assistance.

                   Disclosure of Directed Rulemakings

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                   Constitutional Authority Statement

    The Committee finds the Constitutional authority for this 
legislation in Article I, section 8, clause 18, that grants 
Congress the power to make all laws necessary and proper for 
carrying out the powers vested by Congress in the consideration 
of the United States or in any department or officer thereof. 
The Committee further finds the Constitutional authority for 
this legislation in Article I, section 8, clause 3, that grants 
Congress the authority to regulate foreign and interstate 
commerce.

                    Performance Goals and Objectives

    Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the House of 
Representatives, the performance goals and objectives of this 
measure are to strengthen the agriculture and food system 
supply chain and reduce the associated costs of supply chain 
disruptions for American farmers, ranchers, and consumers.

                        Committee Cost Estimate

    Pursuant to clause 3(d)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the Committee report incorporates the 
cost estimate prepared by the Director of the Congressional 
Budget Office pursuant to sections 402 and 423 of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974.

                      Advisory Committee Statement

    No advisory committee within the meaning of section 5(b) of 
the Federal Advisory Committee Act was created by this 
legislation.

                Applicability to the Legislative Branch

    The Committee finds that the legislation does not relate to 
the terms and conditions of employment or access to public 
services or accommodations within the meaning of section 
102(b)(3) of the Congressional Accountability Act (Public Law 
104-1).

                       Federal Mandates Statement

    The Committee adopted as its own the estimate of Federal 
mandates prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget 
Office pursuant to section 423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform 
Act (Public Law 104-4).

                           Earmark Statement

    This measure does not contain any congressional earmarks, 
limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined in 
clause 9(e), 9(f), or 9(g) of rule XXI of the House of 
Representatives.

                    Duplication of Federal Programs

    This measure does not establish or reauthorize a program of 
the Federal Government known to be duplicative of another 
Federal program, a program that was included in any report from 
Government Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to 
section 21 of Public Law 111-139, or a program related to a 
program in the most recent Catalog of Federal Domestic 
Assistance.

                   Disclosure of Directed Rulemakings

    The Committee does not believe that the legislation directs 
an Executive Branch official to conduct any specific rule 
making proceedings within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 551.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.

        Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force in accordance with 
        section 229.''.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

        Department the Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
        Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force in accordance with 
        section 229.''.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

        Department the Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

            Sincerely,
                                         Phillip L. Swagel,
                                                          Director.
    Enclosure.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

Hon. David Scott,
Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 7675, a bill to 
amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 
to establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for other 
purposes.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Tiffany 
Arthur.
            Sincerely,
                                         Phillip L. Swagel,
                                                          Director.
    Enclosure.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 7675, a bill to 
amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 
to establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for other 
purposes.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Tiffany 
Arthur.
            Sincerely,
                                         Phillip L. Swagel,
                                                          Director.
    Enclosure.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

the Federal Government known to be duplicative of another 
Federal program, a program that was included in any report from 
Government Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to 
section 21 of Public Law 111-139, or a program related to a

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

        Department the Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
        Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force in accordance with 
        section 229.''.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

        Department the Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

            Sincerely,
                                         Phillip L. Swagel,
                                                          Director.
    Enclosure.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

Hon. David Scott,
Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 7675, a bill to 
amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 
to establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for other 
purposes.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Tiffany 
Arthur.
            Sincerely,
                                         Phillip L. Swagel,
                                                          Director.
    Enclosure.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 7675, a bill to 
amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 
to establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for other 
purposes.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Tiffany 
Arthur.
            Sincerely,
                                         Phillip L. Swagel,
                                                          Director.
    Enclosure.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

the Federal Government known to be duplicative of another 
Federal program, a program that was included in any report from 
Government Accountability Office to Congress pursuant to 
section 21 of Public Law 111-139, or a program related to a

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.

                           Brief Explanation

    H.R. 7675 would amend the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Task Force 
would be responsible for evaluating the stability and 
reliability of the agriculture and food system as well as 
identifying specific recommendations to improve the security, 
safety and resilience of the supply chain. The Task Force would 
be required to submit a report detailing its work and 
recommendations to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
enactment of the bill. The Task Force would also wind down 
after the earlier of September 30, 2023, or submission of the 
report to Congress. This bill is additive to complimentary 
ongoing and planned programs that the Department of Agriculture 
is carrying out under existing authorities and funding. The 
Committee's intent behind passage of this bill is in no way 
intended to limit or pause those programs and efforts.

                    Purpose and Need for Legislation

    The Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered 
nearly every facet of daily life and rapidly and dramatically 
transformed how food and agricultural products are consumed 
and, by necessity, how they are produced and delivered. As 
consumers panic-bought food at the retail level and demand 
shifted away from commercial, institutional, and restaurant 
purchasing, the entire food supply chain struggled to adjust to 
accommodate the new market conditions. These changes stressed 
many supply chains, and an uneven recovery that continues to 
disrupt supply chains has been exacerbated by Russia's war 
against Ukraine. The pandemic amplified the importance of 
having a durable and adaptable supply chain. While mass food 
shortages have been avoided in the United States, the entire 
supply chain is encountering raw material shortages, higher 
costs of production, higher prices for goods, delays, and an 
inability to predict demand for operational planning. This 
phenomenon is being experienced in most countries and sectors 
at varying scales.
    Global supply chain disruptions have led to increases in 
the cost of food and fuel in the United States. The other 
factors that play into higher prices are the increased costs of 
shipping and labor, which get passed through onto consumers, 
and changes in consumption dynamics. This confluence of 
challenges has led to inflation--where the purchasing power of 
the dollar is reduced relative to the cost of goods.
    On February 24, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 
14017 on ``America's Supply Chains,'' directing a whole-of-
government approach to assessing vulnerabilities in, and 
strengthening the resilience of, critical supply chains. The 
President also established a new Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force led by the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and 
Agriculture.
    Such complex problems require a comprehensive approach from 
USDA to develop solutions. H.R. 7675 establishes a USDA 
taskforce and special advisor that would coordinate various 
agency equities dealing with supply chain to ensure a 
comprehensive approach. In addition to monitoring and 
evaluating the food and agriculture supply chain's strength, 
weaknesses, and resilience, the Task Force would liaise with 
private-sector stakeholders and the Federal Government 
interagency. It would also facilitate Congressional oversight 
and cooperation by requiring the taskforce to report out to 
Congress on evaluation findings and recommendations. In short, 
this Task Force would help streamline and augment existing 
supply chain efforts at USDA and hold the Department 
accountable for these activities.

H.R. 7675, To amend the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 
    1994 To Establish an Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain 
   Resilience and Crisis Response Task Force, and for Other Purposes


                           Section-by-Section


Section 1. Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and 
        Crisis Response Task Force

    Section 1 amends the Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994, to establish an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    The goals of the task force are to promote stability and 
resiliency within agriculture and food system supply chains, as 
well as ensure availability of goods and inputs from domestic 
producers and key allies of the United States.
    The task force shall engage in a government-wide approach, 
and in collaboration with the private-sector, monitor the 
resilience, diversity, security and strength of the food and 
agriculture supply chain, assist the Federal Government in 
preparing for and responding to shocks, and support the 
creation of jobs with competitive wages in the U.S. agriculture 
and food sector.
    A Special Advisor on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis 
Response, appointed by the Secretary, will head the task force. 
The task force shall coordinate Executive Branch actions to 
carry out these functions.
    The Special Advisor is required to conduct an evaluation of 
the stability and reliability of the food system and supply 
chain and submit a report on the food system's strengths and 
weaknesses, an evaluation of related current laws and 
regulations, and recommendations to address supply chain 
challenges to Congress no later than 270 days after the 
implementation of this statute.

	    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    H.R. 7675 would establish a task force in the Department of 
Agriculture to evaluate the stability and reliability of the 
nation's agriculture and food system supply chain. Under the 
bill, the Secretary of Agriculture would appoint a special 
advisor to head the task force and consult with the Secretaries 
of Commerce and Transportation as part of the evaluation. The 
bill also would require the advisor to report the task force's 
findings to the Congress and recommend ways to improve the 
supply chain's safety, security, and resilience. The task 
force's authority would end on September 30, 2023.
    Using information about the costs of similar activities, 
CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost less than 
$500,000; any spending would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds.
    The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Tiffany Arthur. 
The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis.
