0,108-584 H.txt,    For the Office of the Secretary,"    For the Office of the Secretary, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and the same amount as the budget request.    The Committee appreciates receiving the detailed information provided in the Explanatory Notes prepared by the Department and relies heavily on this information when considering budget proposals. These materials have traditionally been prepared for the sole use of the Appropriations Committee in a format consistent with the organization and operation of the programs and the structure of the Appropriations Act. At the direction of the Office of Management and Budget, the Department has changed the format and content of these materials to focus on broader goals and objectives rather than the major program structure followed in the Act and in the actual conduct of the programs. The new organization and content does not present budget information in a format useful to the deliberations of the Committee. For fiscal year  and future years, the Department is directed to present Explanatory Notes in a format consistent with the presentation used for the fiscal year  Budget. Any deviations from that format are to be approved in advance by the Committee.    When trade sanctions were imposed in , Iraq had been purchasing about  billion in U.S. agricultural commodities each year under the GSM export credit guarantee program. The Secretary of Agriculture has the legal authority to facilitate the export of U.S. agricultural commodities to Iraq by making available new guarantees, notwithstanding current or past debt. In order to begin to rebuild this important market, the Committee urges the Department to offer a GSM program for Iraq as soon as possible.    Counter-Terrorism Measures.--The Committee supports the efforts of USDA in implementing a national policy for defending the agriculture and food system against terrorist attacks.    State Office Collocation.--The Committee continues to direct that any reallocation of resources related to the collocation of state offices scheduled for  and subsequent years is subject to the Committee's reprogramming procedures. The Committee notes that no such reprogramming requests have been received to date.    Ralstonia.--The Committee notes that the Secretary of Agriculture has initiated emergency actions during FY  to ensure the eradication of the disease Ralstonia solanacearum, Race , Biovar , which is of great concern to U.S. agriculture, including ornamentals growers, the potato industry, and others. The Committee directs the Secretary of Agriculture to continue to use existing authority including that provided under CCC, to fund this initiative, and to establish a compensation program for persons suffering from losses as a result of the eradication and control efforts related to this disease. The Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Appropriations a report regarding the feasibility of establishing additional research and forward control programs in countries and/or regions that had been the point of origin for infected product.    Administrative Provision.--The Committee directs the Secretary to advise the Committees on Appropriations in writing of the status of all reports requested of the Department in this bill, at the time of submission of the FY  budget and quarterly thereafter.    The Committee is concerned that the Agricultural Research Service has not yet implemented steps in fiscal year  to expand the access to and use of the United States National Arboretum by private sector and nonprofit organizations. At a time when federal budgetary resources are scarce, it is imperative that the Agricultural Research Service aggressively pursues opportunities to supplement federal funding with funds generated by private sector and nonprofit organizational sources (such as the Friends of the National Arboretum), as other federal institutions have done. Congress clearly stated that it expects the Department to implement a more open and creative policy for use of the National Arboretum at a Congressional oversight hearing held in October . The Committee directs the Secretary to expedite implementation of a more open policy for utilization of the facilities of the National Arboretum as a means of generating supplemental funds to be available for the programs and facilities of the National Arboretum, and to report to the Committees on Appropriations and Agriculture within  days of enactment on the steps taken to implement this directive.    Of the funds appropriated for Title II of P.L. , the Committee directs the Administration to provide adequate amounts for five-year, nonemergency programs in order to reach the  metric ton statutory level. The Committee is concerned about the low level of funding for these programs because chronic hunger increases people's susceptibility to illness, reduces their productivity and income, and makes them more vulnerable to economic downturns and disasters.    The Committee is concerned about the reaction of USDA and some states to a recent discovery in southern California of Phytophthora ramorum, the pathogen that causes Sudden Oak Death. While USDA expanded its regulations in response to the discover of P. ramorum, it failed to enforce a single national standard. Several states have imposed regulations that pre-empt or are more restrictive than the Federal emergency order. As a direct result, nurseries in California have lost customers and markets even for plants that USDA certifies are free of the pathogen. The Committee notes that such actions taken by states are in violation of the Plant Protection Act. The Committee expects the Secretary, when regulating a plant pest, to ensure that the Federal standard is followed to facilitate the interstate movement of horticultural commodities and to fulfill the Department's duties under existing law. While the Plant Protection Act provides a mechanism for states to submit petitions for pre-emption to USDA that must be based on sound science and assessment of risk, no such petitions have been granted in this case.    Continuing information on BSE.--The finding of a case of BSE in a cow in Washington state last year was a matter of great concern to the nation. The Committee appreciates the work by the Department to develop and implement a response plan. Because of the importance of this issue, the Committee needs information on an ongoing basis from the Secretary regarding the BSE surveillance program and the national animal identification program. In light of their importance, the Committee requests a report from the Secretary by July , , on these issues, including a status report on implementation of each component of the BSE response plan, and quarterly reports thereafter.    Beef products from Canada.--The Committee is concerned that USDA improperly allowed the importation of millions of pounds of ground and processed beef from Canada for many months, until the practice was stopped in April by a federal judge. The judge wrote, ``the Court is concerned by the manner in which, according to counsel for USDA, USDA has been authorizing imports of virtually all edible bovine meat products, apparently through issuing individual permits, at a time when it was assuring the public that such authorization would take place through the rulemaking process.'' The Committee shares this concern and requests a report from the Secretary by September , , on specifically how a decision was made to allow these imports, apparently without the awareness of senior officials, and what actions she has taken to ensure this kind of problem will not happen in the future.''"
1,108-584 H.txt,    For the Office of the Chief Economist,"    For the Office of the Chief Economist, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.

5,108-584 H.txt,    For the Office of the Chief Information Officer,"    For the Office of the Chief Information Officer, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The Committee learned that the Department transferred more than  in agency funds to the Office of the Chief Information in fiscal years  and  to help finance several Presidential eGovernment initiatives. The Department testified that, in addition, it collected fiscal years  and  funds in unspecified amounts from USDA agencies for its own eGovernment initiatives. The Committee is extremely disturbed that the Department has failed to comply with Section  of Public Law - that plainly states that no funds may be transferred to the Office of the Chief Information Officer without the prior approval of the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress. The USDA General Counsel's office advised the USDA Chief Information Officer in a memorandum dated April , , that the Department notify the Committees of its intention to transfer funds to the Office of the Chief Information Officer and await a response. Yet, in spite of the clear legislative language and the General Counsel's advice, the Department proceeded to transfer these funds without the notification and approval of Congress. The Department further testified that the cost of these eGovernment initiatives will exceed  in fiscal year , and about its plans to use the Greenbook mechanism to manage agency contributions towards funding these initiatives. The Committee again directs that no funds be transferred, contributed, pooled or otherwise made available from the agencies to the Office of the Chief Information Officer without the prior approval of the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress. The Committee further directs that the Department provide, no later than February , , a report on the fiscal years , , and estimated  funds, transferred to the Office of the Chief Information Officer through interagency agreements, the Greenbook mechanism or any other means. The report should identify the amounts transferred or otherwise made available, by Agency, how those funds were or are to be used and the impact of the transfers on agency program activities."
6,108-584 H.txt,    For the Common Computing Environment,"    For the Common Computing Environment, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available in fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The Committee directs the Department to continue reporting to the Committee on Appropriations on a quarterly basis on the implementation of the Common Computing Environment.    The Committee is aware that the acquisition of geospatial data and Geographic Information System technologies is critical to the Department of Agriculture's plans to modernize its County Service Centers and install a common computing environment that optimizes information sharing, customer service, and staff efficiencies, and improves the Department's ability to track and react to natural and/or man-made disasters. Within the funds provided in this Act, the conferees encourage the Department to provide the appropriate level of support for the acquisition of geospatial data and Geographic Information System technologies."
7,108-584 H.txt,    For the Office of the Chief Financial Officer,"    For the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The Committee has included bill language that directs the Chief Financial Officer to actively market and expand the cross-servicing activities of the National Finance Center.    The Committee is aware that the National Finance Center's (NFC) proposal for e-payroll consolidation was rated the highest in the competition held by the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management. The Committee believes that the NFC's demonstrated ability to provide a high level of service while operating on a fee-for-service basis provides a significant opportunity to utilize a public/private partnership to provide private investment and share risk in the modernization of systems and infrastructure creation for e-payroll. The Committee encourages the USDA to utilize the NFC to create a public/private partnership, such as the one that the State of Louisiana, private industry, and a consortium of academic institutions has developed, to help leverage scarce Federal resources to continue the modernization and development of Federal government wide e-payroll functions.    The Committee directs the Department to submit a report concurrent with the Department's annual budget submission for the following fiscal year, updating the Committee on its contracting out policies, including agency budgets for contracting out, for fiscal year . The Committee is continuing bill language requiring the submission of the report on contracting out policies and agency budgets, prior to use of any funds appropriated to the Office of the Chief Financial Officer for FAIR Act or Circular A- activities."

Proposed project terminations.--Research budgets submitted by the Department reflect a continuing disregard for Congressional program priorities. The Committee has made it clear on a number of occasions that the role of Congress in identifying essential agricultural needs of this Nation will be maintained. Agricultural research projects of regional and national priority will be funded. There has been no adequate justification presented to the Committee to support proposed project terminations. The Committee urges the Under Secretary to end the recycling of proposed terminations which have already been rejected by the Congress. Should similar proposals be submitted again in the budget for fiscal year , the Committee will expect the Under Secretary to explain and defend each proposed termination in detail during the fiscal year  hearings."

Advanced animal vaccines.--There is a continuing need to develop new technologies to mitigate the adverse impacts of disease on cattle, poultry, and swine. The USDA estimates that the annual monetary loss as a result of cattle and swine diarrheal disease is  million in the U.S. alone. Food borne pathogens cause between . million and  million cases of human disease and , deaths annually. The Committee continues the fiscal year  funding level for research on advanced animal vaccines and diagnostic applications currently carried out jointly by ARS, the University of Connecticut, and the University of Missouri.    Aflatoxin in cotton.--The Committee recognizes the promising research the Agricultural Research Service has accomplished to eliminate aflatoxin as an agricultural hazard. The Committee provides an increase of  in fiscal year  for expanded research aimed at lowering aflatoxin levels in cotton.    Air quality.--Many urban areas in the Columbia Plateau are experiencing concentrations of size  microns and small particulates exceeding Federal standards due in part to wind erosion generated from agricultural operations. The Committee maintains the fiscal year  funding level for the ARS Wind Erosion Laboratory at Pullman, Washington for PM- air quality programs for the purpose of meeting the requirements of the Clean Air Act of .    Aquaculture feeds.--Idaho is a leader in the national aquaculture industry, producing over  percent of the nation's commercially grown rainbow trout.

Conservation tillage.--Better management and conservation of natural resources is essential for sustainable crop production in the Columbia River Plateau and regional areas. The ARS Soil Conservation Laboratory at Pendleton, Oregon conducts non-irrigated dryland research important to this region. The Committee maintains the fiscal year  funding level for this necessary research.    Controlling exotic/emerging diseases of crops and livestock.--The Committee is aware of the threat of new diseases and the urgent challenge to American agricultural producers and the increasing concern about bioterrorists and Homeland Security. The Committee understands the possibility that exotic or especially virulent crop and livestock diseases could be introduced. Globalized trade also increases the vulnerability of American agriculture to introduced diseases and pests. The Committee provides an increase of  over fiscal year  to develop systems for rapid response to Bioterror agents; develop vaccines for high priority threat agents; and improve product delivery systems for the control of plant diseases.    Corn germplasm.--Corn is a key resource in this country and throughout the world, providing food, industrial uses, livestock feed, and export. It is important to broaden the germplasm base of corn hybrids grown by American farmers to promote genetic diversity and stability in corn production. The Committee provides an increase of  in fiscal year  to the ARS research laboratory at Ames, IA.    Corn rootworm.--This pest continues to create economic and environmental problems in the Corn Belt region of the U.S. The Committee directs that current research funding of  for the Risk Assessment of BT Corn at Ames, Iowa, be used to fund priority research into the biology of controlling the corn rootworm which poses a significant economic threat to the corn industry.    Cotton pathology research.--The Committee understands that Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum (FOV) is a particularly virulent plant pathogen that attacks cotton. In fact, it is so virulent that the industry refers to it as the cotton AIDS virus.

The Committee provides  in funding for the Web-based Supply Chain Management System in this account, under Commodity Purchase Services, rather than as requested in the Marketing Services account. Administrative expenses to support Section  purposes have been expressly allowed since fiscal year . The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year  stated that funds available under Section  ``shall be used only for commodity program expenses as authorized therein, and other related expenses''. The Committee includes the same language in the fiscal year  bill. Accordingly, the Agriculture Marketing Service may use Section  funds to support computer systems, including a web-based purchasing system, to the extent that such systems relate to program activities authorized by Section . In reviewing the documentation provided with the President's budget request, it is clear that the proposed Web-based Supply Chain Management System is integral to the activities authorized by Section  and funding for the system should be provided in this account.    The Committee is aware of the recent pricing of cranberries below the cost of production that has negatively impacted cranberry producers in growing regions across the country. In addition to marketing restrictions imposed by the Cranberry Marketing Committee, Congress has made both direct payments to growers and directed Section  purchases by the USDA to stabilize the market. Given the anticipated industry inventory of . million barrels during the coming fiscal year, the Committee expects USDA to buy at a minimum the levels equal to historic averages over the past two years, about - million pounds, to prevent market instability.    In the utilization of Section  funds for USDA commodity purchase programs, USDA shall not exclude or discriminate against Farmer-owned cooperatives based on any preference or set asides."

This is an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The Committee expects the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate regulations for the Conservation Reserve Program that defines ``person'', for the purposes of payment limitations for rental payments, in a manner that prevents separate organizations who are controlled by a parent organization from being identified as separate ``persons''.    The Committee is concerned about any Departmental plans to close FSA county offices at a time when the FSA office network is essential to helping farmers address critical economic and environmental issues. The Committee reiterates its strong view that no county office closure or consolidation should occur except in those locations for which closures and relocations are supported by rigorous analysis to ensure actions are cost effective, and that services available to the public will not be reduced.    The Committee provides that  shall be made available for payments to producers who, until September , , had land enrolled in the conservation reserve program in an area that during fiscal year  was omitted from the Cheney Lake Watershed conservation priority area, and whose offers were not accepted during fiscal year , in amounts equivalent to what the producer would have earned in conservation reserve program rental payments during fiscal year  had the offer been accepted."

The Committee directs the Risk Management Agency to develop a Gross Revenue Income Protection program for sorghum, at coverage rates equal to other feed grains.    The  Farm Bill drastically changed the Peanut Program. The per-acre insurance guarantee was reduced to reflect the lower loan rate required by the Bill. This rate is below the cost of production and is not an effective risk management tool for peanut producers. Most peanuts in the U.S. are now marketed through a contract between the Sheller and the Peanut Farmer at a price higher than the loan rate. The Committee urges Risk Management Agency to work with the insurance industry to quickly develop an insurance product that will allow the peanut producer to insure peanuts at an amount equal to the contract value of the crop."

Assuring that all planning that occurs before the approval of an application for Farm Bill conservation programs is charged to Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA), but charge the planning that occurs after the application has been approved (contract planning) to the benefiting program . . .''. This instruction is in clear violation of the fiscal year  Appropriations Act, P.L. -, which directs that none of the funds made available to NRCS may be used to provide technical assistance ``with respect to programs listed in section (a) of the Food Security Act of .'' The Office of the General Counsel has opined that the appropriations language is clear in its prohibition of the use of discretionary CTA funds for Farm Bill conservation programs.

The Committee directs the Chief of the NRCS, in making the fiscal year  Conservation Operations funding allocations to the States, to treat Congressional earmarks as additions to the States' funding allocation. The Committee directs the NRCS to provide a report to the Committee on Appropriations, not later than  days after the enactment of this Act, including the following: fiscal year  Conservation Operations allocation by State, fiscal year  Conservation Operations allocation by State, the fiscal year  Congressional earmarks by State, and the total conservation operations allocation by State.

The Committee recommendation for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is . The Committee notes that since the budget request was submitted last February, estimates for food costs in the WIC program for the current and budget year have increased. The Committee provides an increase of  above the budget request for WIC food costs. The Committee will continue to monitor WIC food costs and take additional action as necessary to ensure that the funding provided in fiscal year  is sufficient to serve all eligible applicants.    The recommended funding level includes  for continuation of the breastfeeding peer counselor program.    Electronic Benefit Transfer.--The Committee recommendation includes language to allow funds to be used for WIC electronic benefit transfer (EBT) systems and sets the authorized level of infrastructure funding at  which includes funding to develop EBT systems.    Farmers' Market Nutrition Program.--The Committee recommendation includes  for the Farmers' Market Nutrition Program account under the Commodity Assistance Program as included in the budget request.    Food Prescription Package.--The Committee directs the Secretary to continue to report to Congress on the status and progress of the National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine (NAS/IOM) review every six months until the review is complete. Further, within  days of receipt of the final NAS/IOM report, the Committee directs the Department to move expeditiously in consultation with WIC agencies to develop for public comment a food prescription rule responding to the needs of the WIC population and to provide a report to the Committee regarding the status and publication of a final rule prior to February , .    WIC Services and Referrals.--While the Committee supports State and local agency efforts to utilize WIC as a means of participation referral to other health care services, it also recognizes the constraints that WIC programs experience as a result of expanding health care priorities and continuing demand for core WIC program activities. The Committee wishes to clarify that while WIC plays an important role in screening and referral to other health care services, it is not the Committee's intention that WIC should perform aggressive screening, referral and assessment functions in a manner that supplants the responsibilities of other programs, nor should WIC State and local agencies assume the burden of entering into and negotiating appropriate cost sharing agreements. The committee again includes language in the bill to preserve WIC funding for WIC services authorized by law to ensure that WIC funds are not used to pay the expenses or to coordinate operations or activities other than those allowable pursuant to section  of the Child Nutrition Act of , unless fully reimbursed by the appropriate Federal agency.    Authorization for the WIC program expired at the end of fiscal year , and at the time of this Committee action, the House authorizing committee has passed a reauthorization bill but the Senate authorizing committee has not yet passed a reauthorization bill."

79,108-584 H.txt,    The Committee provides an appropriation of  for the commodity assistance program,"    The Committee provides an appropriation of  for the commodity assistance program, an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and an increase of  above the budget request.    The recommended funding level for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) is  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and above the budget request. The Committee notes that approximately  in commodity inventory is expected to be available to the CSFP in fiscal year , making the total available for the program approximately .

80,108-584 H.txt,    For Nutrition Programs Administration,"    For Nutrition Programs Administration, the Committee has provided  a decrease of  below the amount available for fiscal year , and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The Committee recommendation includes language to limit new states from authorizing WIC-only stores. The Committee is concerned with the rapid growth of WIC-only stores, WIC Program vendors that solely or primarily market supplemental foods to WIC program participants. The Food and Nutrition Service is directed to promptly provide guidance, regulations, and other documents to each State agency to assure that new WIC-only stores do not get authorized in states that did not have WIC-only stores authorized prior to fiscal year .    The Committee also notes that WIC-only store food costs have been significantly above the costs of stores of similar size and location. Effective vendor cost containment is required. The Committee urges the Food and Nutrition Service to promptly assist each State agency to assure that WIC-only stores are subject to the same requirements as other authorized vendors, as well as such cost containment requirements as are necessary to assure that WIC-only stores maintain food costs that are similar to participating vendors of similar size and location."
81,108-584 H.txt,    For the Foreign Agricultural Service,"    For the Foreign Agricultural Service, the Committee provides an appropriation of  and transfers of  for a total salaries and expenses level of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The Committee recommendation includes:  for pay cost;  for ICASS;  to offset the increased costs in overseas currency rates;  for overseas telecommunications; and  for the capital surcharge being levied on the Foreign Agricultural Service by the State Department.    The Committee provides  for the FAS share of the State Department's ``Capital Security Cost Sharing'' program. This program requires agencies with an overseas presence to fund the construction of new embassies. While the Committee recommends these funds for the fiscal year  cost of the program, there are significant concerns, including: the decentralized funding approach in the plan; significant out-year assessments; cost assignment methodology; and, the uncertainty of future space availability, for FAS, in newly constructed embassies. The Committee understands that GAO is reviewing this proposal and many of these issues will be examined. If the GAO report reveals major flaws in this program, the Committee will reconsider its funding recommendation in the fiscal year  Conference Committee for this bill.    The Committee has included language that allows for the use of not more than  of funds transferred to the Foreign Agricultural Service from the Commodity Credit Corporation for Information Resource Management requirements.    The Committee provides bill language permitting the Department to maintain up to  solely for the purpose of offsetting international currency fluctuations.    The Committee encourages the Foreign Agricultural Service, through the Commodity Credit Corporation, to focus on exports of value-added products and food security packaging issues by leveraging resources that academic institutions such as San Jose State University's Processed Food Institute offer. The Committee expects a report on these efforts by February , .    The Trade Assistance Act for Farmers requires that technical assistance be provided to farmers negatively impacted by imports. This technical assistance is an education program that helps farmers develop marketing opportunities, increase production efficiency and seek alternatives to offset losses created by imports. The Committee directs that from the funds made available by the Trade Adjustment Act that  be available to the Digital Center for Risk Management Education to coordinate an intensive technical assistance program for farmers."

85,108-584 H.txt,    The Committee recommendation includes  for the salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration. Of the total,"    The Committee recommendation includes  for the salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration. Of the total,  is provided in budget authority, and the Committee makes available  in prescription drug user fees,  in medical device user fees and  in animal drug user fees. The budget authority provided is  over the fiscal year  level, and  under the budget request.    Included in this funding level are increases of  for food safety and counter-terrorism activities,  for BSE-prevention activities,  for medical device review, and  for medical countermeasures relating to terrorism. Within the total amount for the agency,  in budget authority and  in user fees are made available for field activities conducted by the Office of Regulatory Affairs. Within the  increase the Committee provides for food safety and counter-terrorism activities are the following:  the full amount requested for inspections;  for the Food Emergency Response Network;  for research;  for biosurveillance; and  for incidence management. The Committee assumes a cut of  from FDA's base resources, as proposed in the President's budget. To maintain agency functions the Committee provides the requested amount for cost of living requirements.    Prior Notice and Facility registration.--The Committee expects FDA to fully consider all comments received during the open comment period regarding the Interim Final Rule for Prior Notice of Imported Food Shipments. The Committee understands that a final rule will be issued in March . The Committee is concerned about FDA's requirement--based in part on the statutory language in section  of the Bioterrorism Act--that all prior notices contain the registration number of the facility where the food was produced. This may impede the importation of certain foods, including wine and products imported into the U.S. for analytical testing or research and development (not for consumption), without materially adding to the security of the food supply. Alternatives when a person filing a prior notice cannot reasonably obtain the registration number of the facility in which the item to be imported was produced should be considered.    Testing food products.--The Committee expects FDA to establish a mechanism for providing prior notice without a manufacturer's facility registration number for food products that are imported for analytical testing or research and development activities that do not involve consumption by humans or animals.    Women's health.--The Committee recommendation includes an increase of  above the budget request for the Office of Women's Health, for a total of not less than . Part of this office's mission is to determine if we are designing systems and collecting data to find the crucial differences between women and men's diagnoses, treatment, and outcomes for a given disease. Coronary heart disease is a predominant cause of mortality in women in the United States, and studies have shown that women differ from men in the symptoms they present, the effectiveness of diagnostic testing, success of treatment regimens, and their prognoses. The Committee directs that, in addition to base resources for that purpose,  of the increase amount is to be used for research, data analysis, and outreach related to cardiovascular disease in women. The Committee provides  of the increase amount for continuation and expansion of the hormone therapy education program.    Orphan products.--The Committee directs that no less than  be available for grants and contracts awarded under section  of the Orphan Drug Act, an increase of  over the amount available in fiscal year .    The Committee encourages the Commissioner to support the Office of Orphan Product Development in the coordination of government-wide efforts to accelerate development and approval of orphan drugs. Concurrent with this, the Committee requests confirmation that the agency's stakeholder initiative is fully implemented in the orphan product area. The Committee also requests a schedule of outreach activities, including workshops and meetings planned for fiscal year , and a list of those that occurred in fiscal year , by January , .    The Committee is concerned about the availability of diagnosis and treatment for rare eye disorders, and requests that the agency update the Committee on progress in this area.    Diagnostic tests.--The Committee is concerned that there has been insufficient attention to the development of diagnostic tests for rare diseases. The Committee requests that the Commissioner, in consultation with the Office of Orphan Products Development, evaluates this situation and reports to the Committee by January , , on current activities and on what steps have been taken to increase FDA's commitment and results in this area.    Rare Diseases Clinical Trials and Drug Evaluation.--The Committee supports rapid access to therapeutics for children and adults with rare diseases. The Committee encourages the FDA to make the best possible use of FDA's Advisory Committee members in FDA's considerations of clinical trial design and allow the same panel to participate in final review meetings, when feasible. The Committee supports utilization of qualified independent consultants as reflected in the draft guidance document ``Independent Consultants for Biotechnology Clinical Protocols'' issued in May . The Committee encourages exploration of potential surrogate endpoints and use of the fast-track process, where appropriate, to make drugs available as early as possible for serious and life-threatening orphan diseases.    Alpha- Antitrypsin Deficiency.--The Committee commends the agency for the progress made in bringing two additional plasma-based therapies to market for the treatment of the progressive lung disease Alpha-. Further, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) is recognized for meeting with consumer stakeholders in efforts to further the development of the next generation of therapies. The Committee encourages CBER to facilitate the development of therapies that will eliminate the dependence of the Alpha- community on plasma-derived products and to foster these therapies in order to treat the entire spectrum of individuals with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.    Labeling of Genetically Modified Foods: Final Rule.--In January , FDA issued a proposed rule concerning food developed through biotechnology. As proposed, the rule would require food developers to notify FDA at least  days in advance of their intent to market a food or animal feed developed through biotechnology and to provide information to demonstrate that the product is as safe as its conventional counterpart. The comment period ended April , . The Committee expects the Agency to make this matter a high priority, and finalize both the pre-market notification rule as well as the related guidance document that assists manufacturers who wish to label their food products as being made with or without ingredients developed through biotechnology.    Spending for the Generic Drugs Program.--The Committee commends the Agency for making progress over the past several years in expediting the review of generic drug applications. In order to ensure that this success continues, the Committee directs FDA to maintain spending for this program at not less than .    Rent and related activities.--The Committee provides a  budget authority increase and expects appropriated user fees to fund the additional amount needed for relocation costs to the White Oak, Maryland, facility.    Financial management.--The Committee recommendation includes the same funding level as fiscal year  for the Unified Financial Management System. Within that amount, sufficient funding should be provided for improvements in FDA's legacy systems. Any additional costs for this purpose, either direct or by transfer, are subject to approval by the Committee. The Committee continues to request regular updates from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) on the progress of the system, its ability to meet agency needs, and updated cost estimates for implementation.    Human resources.--The Committee requests a report within  days of enactment regarding the DHHS human resource consolidation including: an update on the performance metrics specified in the service level agreement between FDA and DHHS; a description of any cases in which the performance measures were not met during fiscal year , and the resolution of those cases; and a list of the DHHS operating divisions that are participating in the consolidation.    Consolidation.--The Committee directs DHHS to include all future consolidations that impact FDA in the President's budget request submitted to Congress.    Fees.--The Committee directs that none of the funds made available to FDA in this bill be used for any assessments, fees, or charges by DHHS unless such assessments, fees, or charges are identified in the FDA budget justification and expressly provided by Congress, or approved by Congress in the official reprogramming process as required in the General Provisions of this bill.    Shellfish safety.--The Committee expects that FDA will continue its work with the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Commission (ISSC) to promote educational and research activities related to shellfish safety in general, and Vibrio vulnificus in particular. The Committee directs the use of not less than  for this effort. In addition, the Committee expects that FDA will continue its work with ISSC through a memorandum of understanding, and that FDA will devote not less than  to that work.    The Committee is concerned that some states are taking actions outside the ISSC process and expects the FDA to urge all states to work cooperatively in conformity with the National Shellfish Sanitation Program implemented by the ISSC.    Food safety.--The Committee recognizes the contributions which the National Center for Food Safety and Technology (NCFST) is making toward ensuring the security of the nation's food supply. The Committee directs that FDA continue to provide  to NCFST through the cooperative agreement. The  in funding shall be exclusive of any additional initiative funds that FDA may award to NCFST.    Test method evaluation.--The Committee directs that the agency continue its contract to conduct method evaluation of rapid test methods of fresh fruits and vegetables for microbiological pathogens with New Mexico State University's Physical Science Laboratory at the fiscal year  level.    WERC.--The Committee expects the FDA to continue its support for the Waste Management Education and Research Consortium (WERC) and its work in food safety technology verification and education at the fiscal year  level.    Antibiotics in shrimp imports.--The Committee continues to have serious concerns regarding seafood safety issues posed by banned antibiotic contamination in farm-raised shrimp imports. The Committee recommends that the FDA, in cooperation with any state testing programs, continue testing of farm-raised shrimp imports for chloramphenicol and other related harmful antibiotics used in the aquaculture industry and ensure that any adulterated shrimp that tests positive for chloramphenicol or other banned antibiotics will be destroyed or exported from the United States.    Dental mercury.--The Committee is concerned about the safety of mercury in dental amalgam, and its classification within FDA's regulatory framework. The Committee understands that recent studies have found high mercury levels in some pregnant women and infants, but have not attributed the mercury to a particular source. FDA proposed to reclassify dental mercury in February  and the rulemaking is not complete. It is the Committee's understanding that FDA has contracted for a comprehensive review and examination of peer-reviewed literature by an independent outside source, which will be completed in the summer of . The Committee requests a copy of the report. The Committee urges the Food and Drug Administration to continue its examination of the peer-reviewed scientific literature on the safety of mercury and take action on the reclassification of dental mercury in light of these scientific findings.    FDA rule.--On January , , in response to the BSE case in Washington state, FDA announced it was issuing new rules banning various bovine-derived material from human food and cosmetics, prohibiting feeding mammalian blood products and several other substances to ruminants, and requiring separation of the production of ruminant and non-ruminant feed. In announcing the new rules, Secretary Thompson said, ``this is the time to make sure the public is protected to the greatest extent possible.'' The Committee is very concerned that FDA has still not published these rules nearly five months later. In the absence of the new rules, compliance with the proposed new safeguards is not required. The Committee directs FDA to issue these rules at the earliest possible time.    Recall improvement.--The Committee directs FDA to list on all FDA recall press releases the website address of the manufacturer of the recalled product--if any--and, when it will assist consumers and the media in identifying it, a photograph of the recalled product and/or product label. The Committee further directs FDA to ask the manufacturer to voluntarily provide information on retail outlets of the product for inclusion on the FDA press release.    Concerns about FDA response.--Information before the Committee raises concerns about a response provided by FDA for the Record to a question from a member of the Committee relating to an FDA official's employment before coming to the agency and current activities by that official. The question was posed due to concerns about a conflict of interest. The Committee is concerned about whether the response was fully forthcoming and whether it may have had the effect of misleading the Committee. The Committee intends to look into this matter further and expects FDA to cooperate fully in this effort."
86,108-584 H.txt,    For Buildings and Facilities of the Food and Drug Administration,"    For Buildings and Facilities of the Food and Drug Administration, the Committee provides no funding, a decrease of  below the amount available for fiscal year  and the same as the budget request."
87,108-584 H.txt,    For the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,"    For the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and  below the budget request.    Report on BSE investigation.--The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') announced in January that it was investigating the possibility that certain commodity traders may have had advance knowledge of the finding of BSE in a cow in Washington state in December, . CFTC said it was specifically looking into ``whether news of the announcement was leaked in advance from government or other sources.'' The Committee directs the CFTC to provide a report to the Committee on its findings as soon as the investigation is concluded."

89,112-101 H.txt,    For the Office of the Secretary,"    For the Office of the Secretary, the Committee provides an appropriation of .    Spending Plans.--Within  days from the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall notify the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress, on the allocation of the funds provided herein by account, and within each account by program, project and activity.    Design-Build.--The Committee encourages the Department to use the design-build method of project delivery when appropriate.    CCC Report.--The Committee directs the Secretary to provide a report on November , , and May , , on planned uses of funding under the authorities of Section  and Section  of the Commodity Credit Corporation Act.    GPS Interference.--The Committee recognizes that the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) is critical to USDA's mission, including natural resource monitoring, forest firefighting, law enforcement, and research. In addition, precision agriculture would not be possible without GPS. It is estimated that U.S. farmers and ranchers have invested more than  billion in GPS technologies. The Committee is aware of a decision by the Federal Communications Commission that may disrupt the use of GPS, causing significant problems for USDA and our Nation's farmers and ranchers. The Committee directs USDA to ensure the FCC is aware of these concerns and to work with other Federal agencies, such as the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation, to address them.    Report on Critical USDA Activities.--The Committee has funded critical research projects, conservation activities and pest and disease functions in the past. Some examples include water use reduction research, fresh produce food safety research, dairy education and extension, conservation fuels management and restoration, and Asian long-horned beetle control. The Committee directs the Department to report on how it is addressing the needs identified by these and other similar activities. The report should be submitted to the Committee by December , .    Know Your Farmer.--The Committee directs the Department to provide an electronic notification to the Committee at least  hours prior to any travel in support of the ``Know YourFarmer-Know Your Food'' initiative, and such notification shall include the agenda for the entire trip along with the cost to U.S. taxpayers. Additionally, the Committee directs the Department to post Media Advisories of all such trips on its website, and that such advisories include the same information.    Cultural Transformation.--USDA is carrying out initiatives such as cultural transformation without a budget request or a specific appropriation for this activity. One of the concerns is the way in which this initiative is spending scarce Federal resources. According to USDA documents, the Department spent  to train  senior leaders on cultural transformation. This appears to be a legitimate expense; however, USDA spent nearly  on personnel and travel to send  employees to one of the most expensive business schools on the East Coast for a week of training. This does not appear to be a wise expenditure of Federal dollars. Furthermore, the Committee does not believe that holding cultural transformation activities on the National Mall is a wise expenditure of funds either. Lastly, the Department has not defined what cultural transformation is, what requirement is attempting to be met, what the goals are, and what measurements are being used in order to determine its effectiveness.    Explanatory Notes.--The Committee appreciates the detailed information provided in the Explanatory Notes and relies on this information when considering budget proposals. For fiscal year  and future years, the Department is directed to present them in a format consistent with the presentation used for the fiscal year  budget with two exceptions. The Committee directs the Department to compare any proposed increase or decrease to the funding provided in fiscal years  and  for the related program or activity. The Committee further directs the Department to include an errata sheet in the Explanatory Notes of any proposed budget authority levels that do not conform to the budget appendix. The Explanatory Notes should be assembled with the accounts in the same order as the accounts in the bill. Any additional deviations from that format must be approved in advance by the Committee.    Late Reports.--Reports requested by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees are an important part of the exercise of the Committees' oversight responsibilities. The Committee is concerned about the Department's delinquency in completing these reports. The Committee is also concerned that the delay is due to excessively long reviews, especially in the Office of the Secretary. The reports are due on the dates specified in either the House, Senate or conference report. Each agency of the Department is directed to comply with the deadlines and to cooperate fully with the Office of Budget and Program Analysis in providing these reports. The Committee reserves the right to call before it any agency that does not submit its report or reports on time.    State Office Collocation.--The Committee continues to direct that any reallocation of resources related to the collocation of state offices scheduled for  and subsequent years is subject to the Committee's reprogramming procedures.    Administrative Provision.--The Committee directs the Secretary to advise the Committees on Appropriations, through the Office of Budget and Program Analysis, of the status of all reports requested of the Department in this bill at the time of submission of the fiscal year  budget and monthly thereafter.    The Committee further directs that the dates established for the receipt of reports requested by the Committee in this report are firm, and that submission of reports is not to be delayed pending completion of the conference on this bill.    The Committee reminds the Secretary that all correspondence related to the directives in this bill must be addressed to the Committee on Appropriations.    Loan and Grant Programs.--The Committee directs the Department, through the Office of Budget and Program Analysis, to provide quarterly reports to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate on the status of obligations and funds availability for the loan and grant programs provided in this bill.    The Committee further directs that if an estimate of loan activity for any program funded in Titles I and III of this bill indicates that a limitation on authority to make commitments for a fiscal year will be reached before the end of that fiscal year, or in any event whenever  per centum of the authority to make commitments has been utilized, the Secretary shall promptly notify the Committees in writing, through the Office of Budget and Program Analysis.    The Committee encourages the Secretary to work with producers who could not file the necessary paperwork within the designated time period for the Crop Insurance program due to flooding and other natural disasters in Presidentially declared disaster areas."

The Committee is continuing bill language requiring the submission of the report on contracting out policies and agency budgets, prior to use of any funds appropriated to the Office of the Chief Financial Officer for FAIR Act or Circular A- activities.    Assessments.--The assessments that the Department charges its agencies for other government- and department-wide activities continue to escalate. Since these assessments are borne by the agencies, and Congress did not specifically provide increases to the agencies for these costs, most of the funding for the increase has come at the expense of programs. The Committee continues to direct the Office of the Chief Financial Officer to scrutinize the need for each activity, to consider its benefit to the mission of each agency, and to limit spending wherever possible."

Foundational Research.--The Committee recognizes the broad responsibilities in agricultural research, education, extension, and economics that Congress has given to the Department. However, it is very concerned with the number and amount of grant awards going to support local and regional food systems, which do not advance knowledge and understanding of the agricultural sciences and appear to have little scientific merit. Given the current budget restraints, the Committee expects the Department to conduct and support only the highest quality, peer-reviewed foundational research.    Brown Marmorated Stink Bug.--The Committee appreciates the work of ARS and NIFA regarding the brown marmorated stink bug. This pest is causing significant damage to agricultural products, particularly tree fruit in the mid-Atlantic States. The Committee encourages ARS and NIFA to work collaboratively with APHIS and state partners to identify and implement appropriate controls."

Priority Research.--The Committee directs the agency to focus its resources on only the highest priority research and building and facility repair and maintenance needs. The Committee remains concerned about the need to control the spread of Ug and provides  for Ug research as requested.    Research Facilities.--The Committee concurs with the Department's proposal to close  research facilities in the following locations: Fairbanks, Alaska; Shafter, California; Brooksville, Florida; Watkinsville, Georgia; New Orleans, Louisiana; Coshocton, Ohio; Lane, Oklahoma; Clemson, South Carolina; Weslaco, Texas; and Beaver, West Virginia. The Committee provides the Secretary the authority to transfer a closed facility to an , ,  or Hispanic-serving agricultural college or university provided the institution agrees to maintain the facility for agricultural and natural resources research for a minimum of  years. The Committee directs the agency to provide a report on the disposition of these facilities by December , .    Research Facility Plan.--The Committee directs ARS to establish a long-term, multi-year plan to guide capital asset construction decisions for new agricultural research buildings and facilities consistent with program missions, goals and requirements. The plan should establish a process for setting and ranking capital asset construction priorities, reflecting the agency's research priorities, and complement the agency's management plans for its planned and existing facilities. The plan should include estimated funding requirements. As the agency develops the plan, it should provide interested parties an opportunity to provide input. The agency should address whether various leasing options, including build-to-lease and building retrofits, are appropriate and under what condition they should be utilized. The Committee encourages the agency to consider planning processes utilized by other Federal agencies, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense, and to incorporate the best strategies from them into the agency's plan. The agency is directed to develop the plan and report to Congress within  days after enactment of this Act.    National Arboretum.--The Committee directs the National Arboretum to maintain its National Boxwood Collection and the Glenn Dale Hillside portion of the Azalea Collection. The Committee encourages the National Arboretum to work collaboratively with supporters of the National Arboretum to raise additional funds to ensure the long-term viability of these and other important collections.    Aerial Application Research.--The Committee recognizes the importance of ARS's Aerial Application Technology Program. The program conducts innovative research making aerial applications more efficient, effective and precise. Research for aerial application serves the public good as a vital tool for the future, as agriculture strives to meet the food, fiber and bio-energy demands of a growing population.    Domestic and Bighorn Sheep.--The Committee recognizes the challenges caused by infectious disease problems arising from wildlife-domestic animal agriculture interactions, particularly between domestic sheep and wild bighorn sheep. Research has recently produced an experimental vaccine to protect bighorn populations from disease, but much work still needs to be done in this area. The Committee encourages ARS to work to determine the role of domestic sheep in causing die-offs of bighorn sheep from respiratory disease and develop methods to reduce transmission and enhance immunity in domestic and bighorn sheep.    Chemical Threat Agents.--The Committee supports the agency's research efforts on emerging chemical threat agents and biological threats. However, it is unsure of the funding needs and requirements for these activities in fiscal year , and as such is not able to recommend a specific appropriation. The Committee looks forward to working with the Department to ensure it can continue this important research.    Verticillium wilt research.--The Committee commends the agency's research that seeks to minimize the effects the Verticillium wilt fungus can have on crops, such as lettuce, potatoes, tomatoes, and cotton, and encourages the agency to continue to work with industry, university, and other partners to develop effective control mechanisms.    Floriculture and Nursery Research.--The Committee recognizes the important research the agency has undertaken regarding floral and horticultural crops and encourages it to continue to work with industry, university, and other partners to address the unique challenges floral and horticultural crop growers face."

Program Management.--The Committee concurs with the proposal to support activities under the Graduate Fellowship Grants and Institution Challenge Grants through the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative. The Committee also concurs with the proposal to consolidate pest control activities under the Integrated Pest Management and Biological Control Program.    Research Priorities.--The Committee regrets it cannot provide an increase for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative for fiscal year . While the Committee appreciates the work of the dedicated staff of NIFA, especially for their efforts to reorganize the agency and raise the profile of agricultural research as directed by the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of , it is concerned about some of the research being funded by the agency. For example, the agency recently awarded more than  million in grants to improve regional and local food systems. Over the past few years, numerous reports from Federal agencies and private philanthropic and scientific organizations have highlighted the need for the United States to invest in agricultural research, particularly to ensure productivity growth and to develop and refine sound natural resources management practices for U.S. farmers and ranchers and others around the world. In light of this advice and the nation's serious budget deficit and debt problems, the agency should be focusing its research efforts on only the highest priority, scientifically merited research. While there are many interesting research topics and a multitude of issues that could be researched, the Committee expects the agency to focus on its core mission of agricultural research by setting a very high standard for research funded by the agency and requiring a rigorous peer review.    Policy Research.--The Committee directs the Director of NIFA to consult with the Office of the Chief Economist in developing any requests for proposals for competitive grants, reviewing applications submitted to the Department, and awarding competitive grants for the activities authorized by  U.S.C. .    Unexpended Balances.--The Committee is concerned that the agency continues to have significant unexpended balances. The Committee directs the agency to provide a report on the balances, including an explanation for its past practices and the agency's plans to improve the management of its appropriation and activities by September , .    Blueberry and Cranberry Research.--The Committee recognizes that the production of blueberries and cranberries is vital to many local economies and encourages the agency to work with partners to support the development of new cultivars to enhance economic stability and develop environmentally sound insect and disease management strategies and technologies.

It is expected that this increased flexibility will allow APHIS to apply the greatest resources to the greatest threats or risks within a line item and to prioritize funds accordingly. The Committee reiterates its previous statements on the need to apply appropriated funds to the agency's historical core programs and mission area first before allocating resources to those less critical functions or initiatives.

Microbiological Data Program.--The Committee does not include funding for the Microbiological Data Program. While food safety is a vitally important part of successfully marketing produce and other agricultural products, other Federal and state public health agencies are better equipped to perform this function. In order for the Federal government to collect the necessary data for microbiological pathogens in produce, FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and/or the state departments of health and agriculture should collect such data under their purview. These organizations also may consider entering into reimbursable agreements with USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service to meet this need.    Country Origin of Labeling.--The Committee accepts the reduction of . million for the Country of Origin Labeling Program as it relates to the completion of a data management system in .    National Organic Program.--The Committee encourages AMS to continue funding for the National Organic Program at the fiscal year  level or above.

GIPSA Marketing Rules.--The Committee is deeply concerned that GIPSA, while well intentioned, misinterpreted the intent of Congress when the agency proposed rules regulating livestock marketing practices as required by Section  of Title XI of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of  ( Farm Bill). Specifically, the Committee believes that the breadth of GIPSA's proposed rule at  FR  unnecessarily extends beyond requirements of the  Farm Bill. In addition, the proposed rule underestimates the future costs of implementing this rule. The bill includes language limiting funding for further action on the proposed rule at  FR  until Congress takes additional legislative action to amend the Packers and Stockyards Act in the next Farm Bill.    The Committee also is concerned about the appropriateness of USDA's actions in this matter with regard to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. Although the Department eventually complied with numerous requests for an extension of the comment period until November , , it did so reluctantly and only after numerous members of the House of Representatives and the Senate submitted requests for an extension, noting the absence of a meaningful economic analysis. The Committee finds troubling the fact that the Department allowed the comment period to close before the last joint Department of Agriculture-Department of Justice Agriculture and Antitrust Workshop was held, possibly limiting public comment. Finally, the Committee is gravely concerned about the propriety of the Department publishing its ``Farm Bill Regulations--Misconceptions and Explanations'' document, which was posted on the GIPSA website more than a month after the proposed rule appeared in the Federal Register. This posting was an unprecedented action by USDA and was published in response to criticisms of the proposed regulations the Department received at a hearing. By all indications, the Department took a particular position and advocated in favor of the proposed regulations. If so, the Department may be discouraging interested persons from participating in the rule making process, and in that regard, the Committee questions whether such actions are compliant with the Administrative Procedure Act.    The Committee directs the Department to provide by June , , all legal opinions and memos prepared by the Office of General Counsel to the Secretary or any other person or agency of the Department regarding this matter."

While the Committee recommendation is  below the fiscal year  Continuing Resolution level, the Committee believes that adequate resources will be available to FSIS to carry out its statutory mandate of meat, poultry and egg products inspection and corresponding microbiological sampling activities. The recommendation includes nearly  in efficiencies and reductions as requested in the budget including the program authorized by Section  of P.L. -. The Committee understands that the funding level may force FSIS to make some choices about the staffing levels that are currently maintained at district and headquarters offices, but the funding level ensures that inspection and sampling activities will be carried out uninterrupted.    HACCP Based Inspection Model Project.--FSIS has a pilot inspection program for poultry slaughter inspection called the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point Based Inspection Model Project (HIMP) that is operating in  facilities. After  years of data collection and several formal science-based studies, FSIS informed the Committee the HIMP model is not only a more efficient means of ensuring the safe and humane slaughter of young chickens (broilers) than the current model, but that this model reduces incidence of salmonella when compared to non-HIMP broiler establishments. By transitioning to this more effective and more efficient poultry slaughter model, FSIS would improve food safety, reduce foodborne illness, and deliver consumer protections by implementing this system industry-wide. The Committee encourages USDA to eliminate any barriers to the expansion of this safer and science-based system.    Humane Methods of Slaughter.--The Committee directs FSIS, to the maximum extent practicable, to ensure that the inspectors hired to improve enforcement of the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act are dedicated to overseeing compliance with humane handling rules.    E. coli serotypes.--The Committee is aware that the latest foodborne illness estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that more than , Americans become sick from E. coli serotypes other than E. coli :H. E. coli :H is already considered an adulterant by FSIS, and the Committee urges the Administration to take the necessary steps against these pathogens to protect the public health."

The Committee encourages the Secretary to utilize all appropriate imagery sources to meet programmatic requirements. The Committee notes that some private companies utilize the images that are collected through the National Agriculture Imagery Program. Given the current fiscal environment, FSA is encouraged to work with these companies to determine if a fee could be paid to FSA for the use of these images.

New Nutrition Requirements for the School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs.--The Committee notes that FNS has responded to the actions required by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of , P.L. -. The Committee urges restraint and practical timelines for implementing new national nutrition standards in the school breakfast and lunch programs. As many of the representatives in states and local school districts have cautioned, an overly aggressive implementation schedule and unrealistic demands on changes in nutrient content can lead to burdensome costs, estimated to be about  billion over  years. Therefore, the Committee directs FNS to issue a new proposed rule that would not require an increase in the cost of providing school meals.    The following table reflects the Committee recommendations for the child nutrition programs:"
158,112-101 H.txt,    For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,"    For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), the Committee provides an appropriation of .    The Committee notes that since the budget request was submitted in February , estimates for participation and food costs in the WIC program have declined from the original estimates for fiscal years  and .    The Committee will continue to monitor WIC food costs, participation, and carry-over funds, and take additional action as necessary to ensure that funding provided in fiscal year  is sufficient to serve all eligible applicants.    Although the total allocation for this bill is . percent below the fiscal year  enacted level, WIC is reduced by a lesser amount or . percent below the fiscal year  level. While funding for this program represents a relatively significant reduction, the Secretary can utilize funding mechanisms at his discretion, including the use of fiscal year  carryover funds, the contingency fund for this account in the amount of  million, as well as other funding options currently authorized in law.    Transfer of WIC funds in FY .-- The Committee is troubled by the action that transferred  million from WIC for an unrelated activity in fiscal year  and insists that USDA work towards ensuring that funds appropriated for this program, and solely intended for this program, benefit this program and WIC participants.    WIC Services and Administrative Costs.--While the average participation in WIC has grown by  percent over the past  years, administrative costs for WIC have grown by  percent or  million dollars between  and . Keeping in mind that some of WIC's program offerings (i.e., nutrition and smoking cessation programs) have expanded over the past  years and state salary and benefit costs have grown with inflation, administrative and service delivery costs as a percentage of the overall cost of the program are excessively high. By the Committee's estimation, administrative costs of operating WIC are well above  percent. In contrast to other social service organizations, the model guidelines by the Federal Government's Combined Federal Campaign require a justification from any local charity that has administrative costs exceeding  percent and the Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance charity standards set a rate not to exceed  percent to cover administrative costs. FNS needs to achieve increased savings through greater use of benchmarking across states or achieve economies of scale whereby the agency and its state partners can decrease the delivery or program costs per participant. These costs pose the greatest threat to fully supporting the vital nutritional needs of all WIC participants. The Committee directs FNS to submit a plan by July , , to reduce administrative costs.    Electronic Benefits Transfer.--The Committee recommendation includes language to allow funds to be used for WIC electronic benefit transfer (EBT) systems and sets the level of infrastructure funding at  which includes funding to develop EBT systems. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of , P.L. - mandated that each state implement EBT for WIC no later than October , . A few states are leading the way on WIC EBT implementation and should serve as models required by other states, including those state plans that take advantage of the states' existing food stamp or SNAP EBT system. As a reminder, the SNAP program did not require states to fully develop Management Information Systems (MIS) or meet MIS standards before implementation of SNAP EBT, and the WIC program also should not make such a requirement. The Committee directs FNS to develop an implementation plan for a more accelerated schedule in order to take advantage of the benefits that WIC EBT would yield for both the Federal, state and private sector stakeholders. FNS should work with state WIC agencies to provide the Committee with the plan by December , .    Categorical eligibility.--WIC provides nutritional support to some of the most vulnerable individuals in the U.S. population. However, due to the Nation's overall financial crisis and the rapidly expanding needs of other Federal nutrition programs administered by FNS, the Committee recommends that the agency focus first on the nutritional needs of those originally envisioned in the creation of this program. While the Committee understands the need to seek efficiencies through the use of Categorical Eligibility, the Committee is concerned that USDA is expanding eligibility well beyond the neediest or hardest hit during the economic downturn. In particular, USDA has confirmed that the WIC program is now serving significant numbers of individuals with incomes above  percent of the U.S. Poverty Income Guidelines, including seven states that use income eligibility limits above  percent of poverty.    The recommended funding level includes  for continuation of the breastfeeding peer counselor program. The Committee also provides  for breastfeeding performance bonuses to WIC state agencies.    The Committee provides  for investments in management information systems."
159,112-101 H.txt,    For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,"    For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Committee provides . The total amount includes  for a contingency reserve in fiscal year .    Fast food pilot programs in SNAP.--The Committee disapproves of the Department's allowance of SNAP funds for fast food restaurants in certain state and territory programs. USDA's own Amber Waves magazine (March ) contained an article entitled ``SNAP Benefits and Eating Out: Wise Choices Required'' that stated the following: `Allowing SNAP participants to use their benefits to purchase food away from home is not likely to result in the healthy food choices found by the researchers' model. Most U.S. households make poorer nutritional choices than those recommended by the Thrifty Food Plan and the Dietary Guidelines. Allowing for SNAP benefits to be spent on food away from home, which is generally nutritionally inferior to food at home, may help SNAP participants balance time constraints and other needs but could also make eating healthy even more challenging. USDA should be consistent in its policies and practices for all nutrition assistance programs by ending this practice.    Fraud, Waste, and Abuse.--While SNAP provides a vital food security safety net to nearly  million people in this Nation, the Committee is concerned about the amount of waste, fraud, and abuse in this immense Federal nutrition program. The Committee is deeply concerned about reports of fraud and overpayments in SNAP. During the testimony before this Committee, fraud alone was estimated at around  million in a single year. As this Committee noted last year, overpayments were expected to exceed . billion, while fiscal year  actual overpayments totaled . billion and fiscal year  overpayments are projected to approach . billion. Between fiscal year  and fiscal year , USDA estimates overpayments at a staggering cost of . billion. This amount clearly constitutes waste that this Nation cannot afford. While the Committee is committed to ensuring that all eligible families receive the assistance to which they are entitled, record budget deficits also require vigilance in defense of precious taxpayer funds. Therefore, the Committee directs USDA to submit a report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations by December , , detailing plans to prevent future improper payments and to reduce future state administrative fees in amounts equal to the estimated overpayments by such states.    The following table reflects the Committee recommendations for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program:Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Account:    Benefits............................................

The recommended funding level for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) is .    The Committee has included  for administrative funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). In addition to the grant funds appropriated for commodity handling and distribution costs, the bill permits states to use up to  percent of the funds provided for purchasing TEFAP commodities to help with the costs of storing, transporting and distributing commodities. The Committee expects state agencies to consult with their emergency feeding organizations on the need for the conversion of such funds.    Increasing Efficiency within the Domestic Food Assistance Programs.--The Committee believes there are potential savings in the delivery of nutrition food assistance services designed to address food insecurity in the United States. The Government Accountability Office issued a report on April , , entitled ``Domestic Food Assistance: Complex System Benefits Millions, but Additional Efforts Could Address Potential Inefficiency and Overlap among Smaller Programs'', that outlines some of the opportunities for more efficient delivery of services. The Committee directs the Secretary to prepare a report by December , , that proposes methods for addressing inefficiencies and redundancies among all programs, particularly smaller programs, while ensuring access to the programs for those eligible. The Secretary should also assess the feasibility and consequences of transitioning those elderly participants in CSFP to SNAP, where possible, as well as options for combining the administrative functions of CSFP and TEFAP. Lastly, the report shall include options for creating greater savings within the state administrative expenses.    For the Food Donations Programs, the Committee provides an appropriation of  for Pacific Island Assistance.    The Committee recommendation includes  for the Farmers' Market Nutrition Program.

Interagency Working Group on Food Marketing to Children.--The  Omnibus Appropriations Act, P.L. -, calling for the establishment of an Interagency Working Group on Food Marketed to Children, made up of members from FDA, CDC, USDA, and FTC. While Congress directed the Working Group to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations no later than July , , this Committee has not received a report to date. Almost two years after the initial meeting of the four agencies, FTC released a draft report entitled ``Interagency Working Group on Food Marketed to Children: Preliminary Proposed Nutrition Principles to Guide Industry Self-Regulatory Efforts.''    While the goal of improving children's diets and addressing the high rates of childhood obesity is laudable, this Committee strongly believes that a number of other critical existing responsibilities now take precedence over the previously required tasks of this Working Group. If the Secretary certifies in writing to the Committee that resources are available after all other statutory mandates are met, the Committee will consider directing USDA to collaborate with other members of the Interagency Working Group to complete a study, based upon peer-reviewed evidence, which examines the extent to which food marketing directed to children (ages  to ) contributes to long-term changes in eating behavior and which identifies a range of strategies that will address long-term eating behavior in children, in order of their effectiveness."

The Committee encourages the Secretary of Agriculture to develop a newly improved process by which the Department's professionals and experts, as well as private sector leaders such as those within the Agricultural Policy Advisory Committee and the six Agricultural Technical Advisory Committees, can provide more expeditious and coordinated support to FAS in their work with stakeholders.    Foreign Aid and Long-term Sustainability in Developing Countries.--This bill includes funding for two international food programs: the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education, a program designed to help support education, child development, and food security for some of the world's poorest children; and the Food for Peace, Public Law , Title II, which provides funding for donations of U.S. food agricultural commodities to meet emergency and nonemergency needs in other countries. The Committee directs FAS to submit a report within  days of enactment that provides options for shifting resources away from funds designated for emergency food aid and to programs that support FAS' duties that help developing countries improve their agricultural systems and build their trade capacity. In constructing this report, USDA must work with U.S. AID to develop long-term efforts that help build market-driven institutions and science-based regulatory frameworks that facilitate trade and create an environment conducive to agricultural growth."

If the President's Budget request for  were adopted, the result would be a  percent increase for FDA since . This level of spending is unsustainable. While the recommended funding level for FDA in this bill is an . percent decrease below the amount provided in the fiscal year  Continuing Resolution, the Subcommittee's overall allocation was reduced by . percent.    Spending Plans.--Within  days from the enactment of this Act, the Commissioner shall notify the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress, on the allocation of the funds provided herein by account, and within each account by program, project and activity.    Food Safety Research.--The Committee urges FDA to collaborate on its research needs where possible to reduce redundancy regarding food safety research in produce and to find efficiencies where possible when constructing new research facilities.    Trade Facilitation & Interagency Cooperation.--The current fiscal environment requires that efforts to enhance safety must be directed towards the most serious compliance infractions. The Committee strongly encourages FDA to establish a pilot project to expedite imports for highly compliant importers. Such project could be modeled on the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism and Importer Self-Assessment programs. The goal would be new trade facilitation methods for low-risk, shippers and cargo that could be incorporated into the import inspection process, thereby enabling FDA to better target Federal resources. FDA is strongly encouraged to provide clear guidelines for those shippers who are low-risk and to collaborate with CBP and other relevant agencies on this work. FDA is directed to provide a report to the Committee on its efforts in this regard by December , .    Independent Post-Market Surveillance.--Concerns have been raised that those at FDA who approve drugs also have a large role in determining how they are regulated for safety in post-marketing surveillance. The Committee directs FDA to issue a report by March , , that would outline the process necessary to create an independent office within the agency that is focused on post-market evaluation with the controls and separation of duties necessary to make unbiased decisions on safety and advocacy. This process should also ensure that the post-market surveillance and pre-market functions can work collaboratively so that science-based, post-market assessments can formally feed back to officials involved with making pre-market drug approvals.    Pediatric Devices.--The Committee supports FDA's efforts in addressing the need for improved pediatric medical devices. Since the inception of Demonstration Grants for Improving Pediatric Device Availability, four consortia funded by the Office of Orphan Products Development have assisted in the development of more than  potential pediatric devices. While the Committee does not have additional resources to provide an increase, the Committee directs that FDA maintain level funding for this program.    Influenza Vaccines.--The Committee is aware FDA has not yet exercised its authority under the Accelerated Approval of Biological Products regulation to approve licenses for adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines that have a proven safety record. While discussions about licensing such a vaccine have been ongoing at FDA, no pathway for approval has been established. The Committee believes FDA has the authority to approve these vaccines and encourages FDA to exercise that authority. The Committee is also aware that clinical studies are needed to further the development of new treatments for emerging public health requirements and for pandemic preparedness. The Committee urges FDA to work with interagency partners to ensure funding is available to conduct these needed clinical studies.    Pediatric Cancer.--The Committee notes cancer remains the leading cause of disease-related death in children. The incidence of childhood cancer is increasing and more effective and less toxic treatments are needed. The Committee recognizes that only one drug has been approved for pediatric cancer in the last twenty years. The Committee encourages FDA to collaborate with industry and the pediatric cancer community to promote the development of new therapies.    Sunscreen.--In August , FDA published a proposed rule for over-the-counter sunscreens that would require UVB and UVA testing and labeling. Given the importance of this rule to protecting Americans against skin cancer, the Committee is concerned that FDA has not issued a final rule. The Committee instructs FDA to issue a final rule before December , .    Gluten-free Rulemaking.--Public Law - required a final rule to define and permit the use of the term ``gluten-free'' on food labels not later than August . Given the importance of this rule to protecting consumers, the Committee is concerned that FDA has not issued a final rule. The Committee instructs FDA to issue a final rule before December , .    OTC Cold Medicines for Children.--The Committee is concerned that FDA has not issued a proposed rule revising the monograph regulating the labeling of over-the-counter cough and cold products for children. The Committee directs the agency to publish a proposed rule by December , , based on scientific evidence for safety and efficacy in pediatric populations and consistent with the October , , joint recommendations of its Pediatric Advisory Committee and Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee.    Medical Devices Advisory Committee.--The Committee commends FDA for convening the General and Plastic Surgery Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee in March  to review the medical device classification of tanning beds. The Committee encourages the agency to act in a timely fashion to finalize its review and make formal recommendations regarding this classification.    Seafood Advisory.--The Committee is concerned about differing messages from Federal agencies to pregnant women regarding the nutritional value of seafood consumption during pregnancy. The Committee directs FDA to initiate formal reconsideration of the  advisory in consideration of the  Dietary Guidelines. FDA shall report to the Committee within  days of enactment of this Act on progress made and a timeline for final action on a new FDA advisory.    Nutrition Labeling.--The Committee is concerned with the proposed rule that FDA issued on April , , on nutrition labeling of standard menu items in restaurants and similar retail food establishments. The proposed rule would include establishments that are not primarily in the business of selling food for immediate consumption or selling food that is prepared or processed on the premises. These establishments are not similar to restaurants and the Committee believes that FDA should define the term ``restaurant'' to mean only restaurants doing business marketed under the same name or retail establishments where the primary business is the selling of food for immediate consumption. The Committee urges FDA to use the proposed alternative definition in the rule that would encompass only establishments where the primary business is the selling of food for immediate consumption or selling food that is prepared and processed on the premises.    FDA Spending.--The Committee is deeply troubled about the expenditure of scarce appropriated funds investigating alleged use of performance enhancing drugs. The Committee can discern no prudent interest for the FDA to investigate allegations that unapproved drugs may have been used outside the United States, where there is no allegation that they were sought to be imported into the U.S. and no risks to public health in the U.S. It exemplifies the problems identified by the GAO in , which found that the FDA has failed to exercise appropriate oversight of the Office of Criminal Investigation or to ensure that its activities are consistent with the FDA's mission and priorities. The Committee takes no position on the merits of any pending allegations, but holds concerns about the use of taxpayer funds for investigations falling outside the agency's core missions."

Spending Plans.--Within  days from the enactment of this Act, the Commissioner shall notify the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress, on the allocation of the funds provided herein by account, and within each account by program, project and activity.    Implementation and Sequencing.--The Committee directs CFTC to develop and publish, with a -day comment period, a schedule of implementation and sequencing of all rules and regulations under subtitle A of Title VII of Public Law -.    IG Report on Cost-Benefit Analysis.--A report completed by CFTC Inspector General (IG) analyzed the limited cost-benefit analysis performed by CFTC during rulemaking under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, P.L. -, as required by Section (a) of the Commodity Exchange Act. The Committee wishes to highlight several of the IG's findings. First, the role of the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) during the cost-benefit analysis was ``dominant . . . (and) had the greater `say''' during the entire process. To begin with, the formulation by the OGC of an analysis template that did not change from a -year precedent due to fear of supposed litigation risk, although CFTC has never been presented with such a challenge in court. The Committee finds this revealing at a time when the Commission, in both its budget proposal and testimony, highlights the need for expanded resources due to ever-growing responsibility. Moreover, the OGC disregarded the opinions of those on the various analysis teams and injected its own views as superior. The Commission's expanded role under the Dodd-Frank Act will drastically effect the financial industry and U.S. economy as a whole. As such, the Commission should adapt its cost-benefit analysis practices to its new responsibilities. Second, the lack of participation, and in certain cases, exclusion of CFTC's Office of the Chief Economist in the cost-benefit analysis process shows a lack of due diligence to wholly consider the economic impact of the rulemaking process. Finally, the report noted the haste with which the cost-benefit analysis took place due to the ill-conceived July rulemaking deadline set forth under the Dodd-Frank Act. Such expediency jeopardizes the diligence of the cost-benefit analysis. The Committee encourages CFTC to reexamine its procedures for cost-benefit analysis and follow the recommendations of the IG in doing so. While the Committee acknowledges that the Commission is not subject to complying with Executive Orders, it nonetheless encourages the Commission to conduct cost-benefit analysis on its proposed rules and regulations in the spirit of Executive Order --Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review.    Exemptions.--The Committee directs the Commission to exempt from margin requirements swaps entered into by commercial end users or entities whose primary business is a producer, processor, or merchant handling an agricultural commodity or exempt commodity, provided that such swaps are used to hedge or mitigate commercial risks related to such commodities."

The Committee does not recommend  as proposed in the budget for cross-cutting trade negotiations and biotechnology resources in the Office of the Secretary. The Committee has provided  in the APHIS account,  in the FAS account, and  to GIPSA for these activities.    Assessment of Conservation Programs.--The Committee directs the Secretary to conduct an assessment of all Farm Bill conservation programs in order to obtain quantifiable data on water quality, soil enhancements, air quality, and wildlife enhancements. The Committee encourages the Secretary to include state natural resource agencies and local units of government, educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations in conducting the monitoring and evaluation of these programs.    Tree Assistance.--The Committee is aware that Western New York fruit orchards sustained major fruit tree damage as a result of a three-day April ice storm earlier this year. An estimated % of the tart cherry trees in Wayne County, New York were severely damaged or destroyed and significant damage was also incurred by the sweet cherry, peach, pear, apple and plum trees in the region. New York is the third largest producer of tart cherries in the nation and Wayne County is the largest cherry-producing county in New York State so these losses will have a significant long-term deleterious impact on the fruit tree industry in New York State. While this region has been declared a federal disaster area and farmers have received some assistance through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, additional federal assistance is greatly needed to cover the expenses of removing the ruined trees and replanting the orchards for tart cherries and other tree fruits. The  Farm Bill provides for such assistance through the Tree Assistance Program. In addition, New York farmers will incur an estimated  million in market losses to their fruit tree crops as it takes new orchards eight years to mature.    The Committee is sympathetic to the plight of tree fruit farmers in New York State and the Committee encourages the Secretary to take appropriate measures, including the use of funds under the Commodity Credit Corporation to provide assistance under the Tree Assistance Program for farmers who have suffered tree losses in  as a result of a natural disaster in a federally declared disaster area.    Productivity of the tree fruit industry.--The Committee encourages the Department to continue to work closely with the tree fruit industry to complete the Technology Roadmap process and develop a national research strategy. The Committee expects the Department to submit a strategic plan as soon as practical, but not later than November , , that includes suggestions for future research initiatives, based on strong public/private collaborations.    Bovine Genome.--The Committee recognizes the importance of the ongoing efforts by the Department, state, and local governments, universities, industry groups, and the private sector, to map the bovine genome. The Committee directs USDA to continue to provide discretionary funding to reach this goal. All funds expended for this purpose shall be used in a direct cooperative effort with the National Institutes of Health.    State Office Collocation.--The Committee continues to direct that any reallocation of resources related to the collocation of state offices scheduled for  and subsequent years is subject to the Committee's reprogramming procedures. The Committee notes that no such reprogramming requests have been received to date.    Ralstonia.--The Committee notes that the Secretary of Agriculture has initiated emergency actions during FY  to ensure the eradication of the disease Ralstonia solanacearum, Race , Biovar , which is of great concern to U.S. agriculture, including ornamentals growers, the potato industry, and others. The Committee encourages the Secretary of Agriculture to continue to use existing authority to fund this initiative, and to establish a compensation program for persons suffering from losses as a result of the eradication and control efforts related to this disease.    Competitive Sourcing.--The Committee is aware of new opportunities to contract with certified third parties for providing conservation program technical assistance. The Committee believes that the use of these technical service providers is consistent with the competitive sourcing objectives of the Department, and directs the Secretary to count utilization of technical service providers toward the NRCS competitive sourcing goals.    Urban Encroachment.--The Committee continues to recognize the major difficulties created by the encroachment of urban areas on rural areas that are also sensitive environmental areas. The Committee believes there is a need to develop a more comprehensive and integrated view of transportation, land use by commercial, residential, agricultural and public entities, and conservation of agricultural and environmental areas. The Committee directs the Secretary to develop a proposal, and identify pilot projects, for such a comprehensive program, in partnership with State or local government agencies, fully utilizing and coordinating the Farm Service Agency and Natural Resources Conservation Service authorities and discretion in order to achieve this important objective in Orange and Riverside Counties in California.    Administrative Provision.--The Committee directs the Secretary to advise the Committees on Appropriations in writing of the status of all reports requested of the Department in this bill, at the time of submission of the FY  budget and quarterly thereafter.    Lamb Meat Adjustment Assistance Program.--The Committee commends the Department on the success achieved with the Lamb Meat Adjustment Assistance Program. However, the Committee also recognizes that the ewe lamb expansion portion was curtailed as a result of the serious drought conditions throughout the U.S. The Committee encourages the Department to continue this portion of the program for an additional year through the use of Section  funds.    Quality Grading.--The Committee directs the Department to submit a report detailing the practice of quality grading foreign and domestic lamb, beef, and pork carcasses, and the use of the USDA Quality Shield in this process.    Insular Areas.--The Committee is concerned that the fiscal year  budget request did not include any funds to implement the Resident Instruction and Distance Education Grants Program for Insular Area Institutions of Higher Education, authorized by section  of Public Law -. The needs of institutions of higher education in U.S. territories are unique, and are deserving of consideration. The Committee encourages the Secretary to provide within existing authority such assistance to these institutions as may be appropriate, and to provide to the Committee prior to the fiscal  hearings a report describing what steps are being taken to respond to these needs."

The Committee has included bill language that directs the Chief Financial Officer to actively market and expand the cross-servicing activities of the National Finance Center.    The Committee is aware that the National Finance Center's (NFC) proposal for e-payroll consolidation was rated the highest in the competition held by the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management. The Committee believes that the NFC's demonstrated ability to provide a high level of service while operating on a fee-for-service basis provides a significant opportunity to utilize a public/private partnership to provide private investment and share risk in the modernization of systems and infrastructure creation for e-payroll. The Committee encourages the USDA to utilize the NFC to create a public/private partnership, such as the one that the State of Louisiana, private industry, and a consortium of academic institutions has developed, to help leverage scarce Federal resources to continue the modernization and development of Federal government wide e-payroll functions.    In the reports accompanying its fiscal year ,  and  bills, the Committee addressed the issue of contracting out. The Committee noted its concerns about the potential cost benefit impact of contracting out and about the needs of customers in programs such as those of the Rural Development Services and the Farm Service Agency.    The Committee also directed the Department each year to submit a report concurrent with the Department's annual budget submission for the following fiscal year, ``on its contracting out policies, including agency budgets for contracting out.'' The Department has failed to comply with this directive for three years.    The Committee intends its directives to be carried out by the Department. The reports it requested are essential to the Committee conducting its oversight responsibilities.

While some agro-terrorism research is already being done by the Department of Agriculture, the Committee is aware of the need for more such research, particularly in the areas of threats to field crops, farm animals, and food in the processing and distribution chain. The Homeland Security Act of  provides for coordination of research between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other relevant federal agencies in various areas of research. Because the Department of Agriculture (USDA) already possesses mechanisms, authorities, and personnel to carry out needed agro/bioterrorism research, the Committee expects to see effective coordination between the USDA and the DHS to move such research forward in an effective and expeditious fashion. The Committee expects USDA to coordinate with DHS to identify research gaps and develop a plan, to include research priorities, for proceeding to fill such gaps. Further, the Committee expects that non-government entities selected to carry out research will be ones with proven expertise in agriculture research, and strong familiarity with USDA animal and plant diagnostic laboratories and practices.    Proposed project terminations.--Research budgets submitted by the Department reflect a continuing disregard for Congressional program priorities. The Committee has made it clear on a number of occasions that the role of Congress in identifying essential agricultural needs of this Nation will be maintained. Agricultural research projects of regional and national priority will be funded. There has been no adequate justification presented to the Committee to support proposed project terminations. The Committee urges the Under Secretary to end the recycling of proposed terminations which have already been rejected by the Congress. Should similar proposals be submitted again in the budget for fiscal year , the Committee will expect the Under Secretary to explain and defend each proposed termination in detail during the fiscal year  hearings."

The recommendation does not include  in user fees to be paid by industry for Federal inspections, as proposed in the President's budget. These user fees are not currently authorized in law. The Committee does not recommend establishing such fees in annual appropriations acts, but will consider such fees should they achieve authorization.    The Committee provides the full amount requested for inspection activities, including funds to meet needs caused by industry growth; scientific training for personnel; pathogen sampling and risk assessment; laboratory capacity; an educational campaign; and international audits. The Committee notes that activities related to enforcement of the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act are fully funded; in addition to funds provided for inspections in the Committee recommendation for fiscal year , the fiscal year  appropriations act provided  in funds for inspection that remain available through fiscal year . The Committee did not fund the request for non-salary related inflation and retirement costs, as these were not requested--or funded--in any other account.    The Committee provides the agency with  solely to outsource microbiological testing, as requested in the President's budget, with the goal of establishing a continuous baseline program for risk assessment and performance measurement. The Committee expects the Department to outsource baseline testing to private American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (ALA) International Standards Organization (ISO) approved laboratories. The Committee directs the Department to report on the progress of this initiative within  days of enactment.    Food Safety Education Campaign Pilot.--The Committee is aware of the Department's efforts to enhance their activities and promotional campaigns to better educate the general public about the risks associated with food borne pathogens. However, given the limited focus of specific media outreach efforts to some of the most ``at risk'' audiences such as our senior citizens, the Committee expects the Department to establish a regional pilot project to provide outreach to this segment of the population. In particular, the Committee is very concerned about the risks posed to seniors in regions of the country such as the northeast, southeast, and Great Lakes representing the highest concentrated populations of older Americans in the country and encourages the Department to target such areas."

This is an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and the same as the budget request.    County Offices.--The Committee is concerned about any Departmental plans to close FSA county offices at a time when the FSA office network is essential to helping farmers address critical economic and environmental issues. The Committee reiterates its strong view that no county office closure or consolidation should occur except in those locations for which closures and relocations are supported by rigorous analysis to ensure actions are cost effective, and that services available to the public will not be reduced.    Milk Income Loss Contract program.--Local county FSA offices are struggling with record workloads due to the requirements of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of . Wisconsin is especially burdened because of the nearly , dairy farmers who are eligible to receive benefits under the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program, approximately  percent of all dairy operations in the United States. It is estimated that Wisconsin needs - additional employees just to administer the MILC program. Short staffing at county offices is taking a tremendous toll on loyal employees and hurting the services that farmers receive. As such, the Committee directs the Department to increase staffing levels at county offices in Wisconsin by at least  staff years.    Peanut Promotion Assessments.--Historically, the Farm Services Administration (FSA) has deducted assessments mandated by Federal and State laws when peanuts go into the USDA loan program. These assessments are used to fund research and promotion programs that peanut growers vote for in referenda conducted pursuant to Federal and State laws.    In the course of implementing the new peanut program authorized by the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of , FSA for the first time, refused to collect the assessments when peanuts are put into the loan program. However, the changes in the law for the new program did not require FSA to cease collecting the assessments. The new policy created great confusion in the marketplace and has inhibited the ability of peanut growers to fund their research and promotion programs. It is especially confusing because private entities who buy peanuts from producers must comply with State and Federal law and collect these assessments. Therefore, the Committee encourages FSA to revert to its previous practice of collecting assessments mandated by Federal and State statutes on peanuts when a producer places peanuts under loan. The Committee directs FSA to report within six months how it plans to comply with the Committee's directive."

244,108-193 H.txt,    For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,"    For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) the Committee provides an appropriation of  a decrease of  below the amount available in fiscal year  and  below the budget request.    The Committee recommendation for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is  which will provide the program with the resources to serve approximately . million women, infants and children, as estimated in the President's budget. The Committee notes that, since the budget request was submitted last February, estimates for food costs in the WIC program for the current and budget year have declined and participation in fiscal year  is below the budgeted amount. Therefore, the recommended funding level, although significantly below the budget request, is sufficient to meet program needs and to allow for certain additional investments in the program, as requested by the President. The Committee recommendation assumes a carryout of  into fiscal year .    The recommended funding level includes  for a breastfeeding peer counselor program,  for investments in management information systems, and  for pilot projects to combat obesity in children. The Committee provides  for the WIC contingency fund, as requested. The Committee notes that it provided  for the WIC contingency fund in the fiscal year  appropriations act, to remain available until expended. The Committee has been informed that the Secretary does not anticipate use of these funds in fiscal year ; therefore, the Secretary will have a total contingency fund of  available for WIC food costs if necessary.    Authorization for the WIC program expires at the end of fiscal year , and at the time of this Committee action, the House authorizing committee had not yet taken action on reauthorization. Therefore, the budget request and the Committee assume extension of current services into fiscal year .    Electronic Benefit Transfer.--The Committee recommendation includes language to allow funds to be used for WIC electronic benefit transfer (EBT) systems and sets the authorized level of infrastructure funding at  which includes funding to develop EBT systems.    Farmers' Market Nutrition Program.--The Committee recommendation includes  for the Farmers' Market Nutrition Program account under the Commodity Assistance Program as included in the budget request.    Food Prescription Package.--Although the Department has requested that the National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine, review and comment on the WIC food packages and make recommendations to the Department, the Committee continues to be concerned that this review will further delay the publication of proposed rules to revise the regulations governing the WIC food packages. The Committee directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the status and progress of the NAS/IOM review every six months until the review is complete. Further, within  days of receipt of the final NAS/IOM report, the Committee directs the Department to move expeditiously in consultation with WIC agencies to develop for public comment a food prescription rule responding to the needs of the WIC population and to provide a report to the Committee regarding the status and publication of a proposed rule prior to February , .    WIC Services and Referrals.--While the Committee supports State and local agency efforts to utilize WIC as a means of participation referral to other health care services, it also recognizes the constraints that WIC programs experience as a result of expanding health care priorities and continuing demand for core WIC program activities. The Committee wishes to clarify that while WIC plays an important role in screening and referral to other health care services, it is not the Committee's intention that WIC should perform aggressive screening, referral and assessment functions in a manner that supplants the responsibilities of other programs, nor should WIC State and local agencies assume the burden of entering into and negotiating appropriate cost sharing agreements. The Committee again includes language in the bill to preserve WIC funding for WIC services authorized by law to ensure that the WIC funds are not used to pay the expenses or to coordinate operations or activities other than those allowable pursuant to section  of the Child Nutrition Act of , unless fully reimbursed by the appropriate Federal agency.    Interim Regulations on Infant Formula.--The Committee is concerned that the Department has published interim infant formula cost containment regulations without the benefit of public comment, failing to consider State agencies' experience with bidding and contracting and preventing States from negotiating the best contract for individual circumstances. The Committee directs the Department to partner with WIC State agency directors to review the interim regulations and propose regulatory changes to appropriately respond to States' concern assuring maximum participant benefits."

The Committee recommendation includes:  for trade and biotechnology resources;  for increased ICASS costs; and  for increased overseas rent costs. The Committee does not concur with the President's budget request of  for the Montreal Protocol Fund.    Azores.--The Committee urges the Department to devote necessary resources to establish the Azores Collaborative Research and Education Group to assist the U.S. Government in meeting its treaty obligations to the government of Portugal.    Currency fluctuations.--The Committee provides bill language permitting the Department to maintain up to  solely for the purpose of offsetting international currency fluctuations."

252,108-193 H.txt,    The Committee recommendation includes  for the salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration. Of the total,"    The Committee recommendation includes  for the salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration. Of the total,  is provided in budget authority, and the Committee makes available  in prescription drug user fees and  in medical device user fees. The budget authority provided is  over the fiscal year  level, and  under the budget request. Included in this funding level are increases of  for the generic drugs program,  for food safety and counter-terrorism activities, as requested,  for implementation of the Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act,  for patient safety and adverse event reporting,  for review of over-the-counter drugs, and  for relocation expenses.    The Committee has also provided an increase of  over the budget authority amount in the President's budget request for the medical device program, for a total of  in budget authority and  including user fees. To maintain agency functions the Committee provides the requested amount for cost of living requirements.    The Committee fully supports the agency's efforts to streamline the generic drug application review function. The Committee recommendation includes  for the generic drugs program, a  percent increase over the current level. The  increase provided specifically for the generic drug program, as well as that program's share of the pay cost increase provided, will allow FDA to hire  additional reviewers and inspectors in order to review at least  percent of applications within  days of receipt, with the goal of decreasing average review time by at least one and a half months.    In a Subcommittee hearing this year, the FDA Commissioner noted studies that found that physicians are confused about the efficacy of generic drugs compared to brand name products and about cost differences between generics and name brand drugs. He suggested that an education campaign targeted at physicians and medical students would be something he would be interested in pursuing if additional funds were available. The Committee shares the Commissioner's interest in this matter, and therefore, requests FDA to submit a report to the Committee, in advance of the conference on the FY  bill, on how such a campaign might be designed and what it would cost.    The Committee notes that the proposed budget for the Food and Drug Administration included a reduction to the base programs of  due to management and information technology efficiencies, as well as  in cost absorptions. Although the Committee is in favor of creating greater efficiency in programs, it is concerned about the effect of such reductions on program delivery. For example, the President's budget request includes a total of  in cuts to the medical devices program. That amount represents over seven percent of that program's current budget authority, although program performance has not been at an acceptable level.    The Committee recommendation includes adequate budget authority to meet the required level of funding for human prescription drug review activities, so that prescription drug user fee funds may continue to be collected and available to the agency. The Committee notes that its recommendation includes a transfer of the biologics therapeutic review function and funds, which total  into the human drugs program from the biologics program, as requested in the President's budget.    The recommended funding level includes  for relocation expenses related to the move of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research offices to the consolidated White Oak campus instead of  as requested. It is expected that carryover funds available in the Prescription Drug User Fee Account can fund the remaining  needed, since this phase of the move involves the new drug review functions of the Center.    Within the animal drugs and feeds program, the recommendation does not include  in user fees for animal drug application review. These user fees are not currently authorized in law. The Committee does not recommend establishing such fees in annual appropriations acts, but will consider such fees should they achieve authorization. The Committee recommendation for the animal drugs and feeds programs preserves funding for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) prevention activities at .    The Committee recommendation includes an increase of  for the Office of Women's Health (OWH), to make total funding for OWH not less than . Of this increase, not less than  should be dedicated to supporting and implementing important women's health outreach activities, including the hormone replacement education initiative that was started in fiscal year . It is critical that the Office of Women's Health have the resources to partner with medical professional and women's health groups, as well as other Federal agencies, to conduct a comprehensive public awareness outreach campaign about the appropriate use of hormone therapy, including the treatment of menopausal symptoms.    The recommended funding level includes a  increase for over-the-counter (OTC) drug programs, instead of  as requested. The Committee agrees that OTC drugs play an increasingly important role in the healthcare system. The increase in funding should be used to hire and train five additional FTEs to improve the OTC drug review process, develop and work toward finalizing OTC drug monographs, and conduct consumer behavior research that would be used to identify and manage potential risks of OTC drugs. The increase in funding should also be used to facilitate the approval of new drug applications to switch drugs from prescription to nonprescription status. The Committee expects that FDA's first priority should be to finalize switch applications currently under review. Next, the increase should be used to improve on the long history of cooperation between the agency and switch applicants that has resulted in over  successful switches since , and FDA should work with industry to proactively identify future candidates for switch applications.    Prescription Drug Monograph System.--The Committee requests a report from FDA regarding the feasibility and cost of a new monograph system for prescription drug products that have been marketed to a material extent or for a material time without a premarket approval, provided such products are without apparent safety or efficacy problems. Enforcement resources regarding pharmaceutical products should be dedicated to activities that are most likely to improve public health.    The Committee recommendation includes a total of  for the Unified Financial Management System. Any additional costs for this purpose, either direct or by transfer, are subject to approval by the Committee. The Committee continues to request quarterly updates on the progress of the system, its ability to meet agency needs, and updated cost estimates for implementation.    The Committee should be kept fully informed of consolidation efforts in the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) that affect the Food and Drug Administration. The current proposal to consolidate human resources functions has not been sufficiently explained or justified. Indeed, the Department has been unable to identify the costs to the FDA of the consolidation for fiscal years  or . The FDA should not pay any bills to the Department for the consolidation of human resources functions without Committee approval through the reprogramming process. The cost to FDA of the consolidation should not exceed what it currently costs to operate human resources functions within the FDA, and the level of service should be equal to that provided by the FDA human resource staff.    The Committee expects the FDA to continue its support for the Waste Management Education and Research Consortium (WERC) and its work in food safety technology verification and education at no less than the fiscal year  level.    Alpha- Antitrypsin Deficiency.--The Committee notes the importance of expedited review for new therapies for the progressive degenerative lung disease Alpha-. Currently this patient population is dependent on a sole source therapy that is in critical short supply. The Committee encourages the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to allocate adequate resources to the Office of Blood Research and Review to promote the timely review of new products that have been submitted for licensure and requests a report on the progress that has been made by March , .    Shrimp/Chloramphenicol.--The Committee has concerns regarding the adequacy of FDA efforts to address seafood safety issues, particularly chloramphenicol contamination in farm-raised shrimp imports. The Committee understands that FDA has increased its sampling rate of farm-raised shrimp imports fourfold, and encourages increased sampling over the current rate. The Committee also expects FDA to validate and employ the most current test methods for chloramphenicol, including development of testing capability for cold-storage inventories. The Committee directs the agency to report on its sampling frequency and violation rates for imported shrimp, and its efforts to ensure that any shrimp that test positive for chloramphenicol will not be subsequently consumed.    Food Freshness.--The Committee understands that FDA has asked the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF) to provide advice on the necessary scientific parameters for establishing safety-based use-by dates for refrigerated ready-to-eat foods to help reduce the incidence of foodborne listeriosis. The Committee directs FDA to provide the NACMCF report when it becomes available in .    Shellfish Safety.--The Committee expects that FDA will continue its work with the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Commission (ISSC) to promote educational and research activities related to shellfish safety in general, and Vibrio vulnificus in particular. The Committee directs the use of not less than  for this effort. In addition, the Committee expects that FDA will continue its work with ISSC through a memorandum of understanding, and that FDA will devote not less than  to this effort.    Color Certification Fees.--The Committee understands that fees paid by the color certification industry have been used to pay rent on a much larger facility than is needed in fiscal year , due to logistics of using a temporary space, and that the same situation is expected in the budget year. The Committee is concerned that this temporary rent increase will be the basis for an increase in assessed fees for the industry. The Committee expects FDA to calculate fees based on reasonable expenses, excluding the anomaly of increased rent in fiscal years  and . The Committee notes that augmentation of the FDA budget by the color certification fees is allowable only to offset reasonable expenses of running the color certification function, and that a separate accounting of the fees and expenses must be kept.    Test Method Evaluation.--The Committee directs that the agency continue its contract to conduct method evaluation of rapid test methods of fresh fruits and vegetables for microbiological pathogens with New Mexico State University's Physical Science Laboratory at the fiscal year  level.    Plasma Therapeutics Lot Release.--It is the Committee's understanding that the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) is analyzing the lot release process in order to determine what factors increase the review time and to set a performance goal for lot release. The Committee is encouraged that CBER is evaluating its performance, and suggests that reviewing and acting on  percent of lots of plasma therapeutics within thirty days of receipt is an acceptable level of performance. The agency is directed to report its final plasma therapeutics performance goal, and its performance related to that goal, to the Committee within  days of enactment.    Detroit District Office.--The Committee is pleased that FDA plans to relocate the Detroit District Office within the city center of Detroit, and that a long-term lease has been signed. The Committee supports the increase in personnel assigned to the Detroit District Office to meet needs in that area, and expects that the current level of  Full Time Equivalent employees will be maintained or exceeded in the budget year.    Standard of Identity for Yogurt.--The Committee supports the agency's plans to issue an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) in August  to solicit comments on the petition regarding the standard of identity for yogurt. The Committee expects to receive notice when the ANPR is published, and to be briefed within  days of the close of the ANPR comment period on the comments received and on agency plans to issue a proposed rule on the yogurt standard of identity.    The Committee requires that the Commissioner of Food and Drugs work in consultation with the Director of the National Cancer Institute on a strategic plan to expedite the development of chemoprevention cancer drugs and report back to the Committee by March , .    The Committee is aware that FDA has under review a petition to allow for the use of ultrafiltered milk as an ingredient in standardized dairy products such as cheese and that cheesemakers may seek similar treatment for imported Milk Protein Concentrate (MPC). The Committee is concerned about this petition, and directs FDA to provide it with regular quarterly reports on the status of its review of any petitions to use ultrafiltered milk, casein or MPC in dairy products that have standards of identity.    Seafood Safety.--The Committee is concerned that seafood Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) requirements for imported seafood are not being met. FDA's HACCP guidelines contain recommendations regarding temperature and time requirements for certain seafood products. However, as agency inspectors cannot check the temperature of the seafood while it is in transit, compliance with this guideline cannot be ensured. Regarding seafood, FDA has the duty to identify preventive measures the processor and importer can apply to control microbiological hazards. The Committee requests a report from the FDA, including the following information: a description of the HACCP temperature requirements for imported seafood products and controls currently in place to test temperature in transit; identification of tests or technology to aid in determining compliance with the temperature requirements; a description of the frequency of inspection and the sampling performed, and if temperature of the product was taken upon arrival, before the product entered a chill facility. The report should also identify any planned or ongoing FDA research projects on the effectiveness of new technologies to control hazards due to improper temperature. The report should be submitted to the Committee by January , ."

256,117-392 H.txt,    For the Office of the Secretary,"    For the Office of the Secretary, the Committee provides an appropriation of .    Similar to prior years, the Committee does not include direct funding for activities that are currently funded through other resources such as the Working Capital Fund or that have historically been funded through other means.    The Committee provides  for the Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement (OPPE), including an increase of  for additional staff.    Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Report.--The Committee directs the Secretary to provide a report on November , , and May , , on planned uses of funding under the authorities of Section  and Section  of the CCC Charter Act.    CCC Obligations and Commitments.--The Secretary is directed to notify the Committees in writing  days prior to any announcement on the use of funds from the CCC or to the obligation or commitment of any emergency funds from the CCC.    Communication from USDA.--A collaborative working relation- ship between the Committee and USDA is necessary to ensure efficient and effective implementation of Congress' funding decisions. USDA is directed to ensure that the Committee is notified of major changes to existing policies and any significant developments in its operations, before providing non-governmental stakeholders such information, before making the changes public and before implementing them.    Explanatory Notes.--The Committee appreciates the Department's work to restore the Explanatory Notes to the same format as they had been presented prior to fiscal year  and directs that this format be maintained for fiscal year  and beyond.    FSA State Directors.--The Committee directs the Secretary to prioritize the appointment of State Executive Directors of the Farm Service Agency and work expeditiously with the White House to confirm each State Executive Director in an appropriate timeframe consistent with the duties and activities this leadership role provides. The Committee recognizes that State Executive Directors play an integral role in employee training, the delivery of critical farm support programs, and is essential in the overall operations of the state and local Farm Service Agency offices who serve at the forefront of the Department's customer-based services.    Foods for Health.--The Committee recognizes USDA can do more to support local food producers and encourages efforts to increase local food purchases for hospitals, clinics, and health providers to support food prescription programs that provide medically tailored foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables, to patients for the prevention or management of diet-impacted health conditions and improvements in dietary health.    Food Waste Consumer Education.--The Committee recommends that USDA enter into public-private partnership to provide consumer-facing outreach on food loss and waste and prevention strategies.    Grain Terminals.--The Committee notes the ongoing contract negotiations between West Coast grain terminal operators and the union recognizes the importance of reaching an agreement that works for both parties. A failure to reach an agreement could result in an interruption in grain terminal service that would negatively impact the nation's grain exports. The Committee urges all parties to continue negotiating in good faith to ensure an equitable outcome for both grain terminal operators and their workers is expeditiously reached.    Hemp Extract Regulation.--The Committee is concerned about the inconsistencies in the regulation of the production of hemp by USDA and DEA. Congress vested primary regulatory authority in USDA and expects other regulatory actions to align with it. Congress intentionally expanded the definition of hemp to include derivatives, extracts and cannabinoids in an effort to avoid the criminalization of hemp processing. Committee understands that in-process hemp extract may temporarily exceed the delta- THC concentration of .% before being packaged and sold as a finished product for consumption. Therefore the Committee directs USDA to coordinate directly with the DEA to present the industry with guidance and information on in-process extracted material.    Loan and Grant Programs.--The Committee directs that if an estimate of loan activity for any program funded in Titles II and III of this bill indicates that a limitation on authority to make commitments for a fiscal year will be reached before the end of that fiscal year, or in any event when  percent of the authority to make commitments has been utilized, the Secretary shall promptly notify the Committees through the Office of Budget and Program Analysis (OBPA). The Committee directs the Department, through OBPA, to provide quarterly reports to the Committees on the status of obligations and funds availability for the loan and grant programs provided in this bill.    National Finance Center.--The National Finance Center (NFC) is the largest designated Federal Government Payroll Shared Service Provider and it provides integrated payroll and personnel services for over , Federal employees. To ensure that thousands of Federal employees' pay and human resources services are not interrupted or adversely impacted by major organizational changes, the Committee has modified requirements under current law relating to NFC payroll and shared services operations, missions, personnel, and functions. The Committee also directs the USDA to provide quarterly reports on full-time equivalent (FTE) levels for each of the current NFC divisions, operations, and functions, as well as each of the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) and Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) divisions, operations, and functions currently co-located with the NFC. The reports also are to include a detailed breakdown of the FTEs for each and any of these same divisions, functions, or operations for the NFC and the co-located OCFO and OCIO functions compared to those during FY  and .    Native Plant Use Preference.--The Committee continues to support the use of locally adapted native plant materials in the undertaking of land management activity on Federal lands under the jurisdiction of USDA, including in maintenance and in restoration in response to degradation caused by human activity or natural events (such as fire, flood, or infestation). The Committee continues to direct that it be the policy of the USDA that preference shall be made to the extent practicable for the use of locally adapted native plant materials in these cases.    New Initiatives.--The Committee requests USDA, no later than  days after enactment, to submit an execution plan for each new initiative funded in this Act. This strategy should include, but is not limited to, the steps necessary to make funding available, the timeline thereof, targeted beneficiaries, and expected results. The Committee requests quarterly reports on these initiatives until the initiative has been fully implemented.    Notification Requirements.--The Committee reminds the Department that the Committee uses the definitions for transfer, reprogramming, and program, project, and activity as defined by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). As noted in the  Joint Explanatory Statement, a program, project, or activity (PPA) is an element within a budget account. PPAs are identified by reference to include the most specific level of budget items identified in the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Act, , accompanying Committee reports, explanatory statements, and budget justifications. The Committee notes that the most specific level of budget items in the USDA budget justifications is not limited to tables titled ``Project Statement''.    Outreach and Assistance for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers and Veteran Farmers and Ranchers.--The Committee recognizes the importance of the Outreach and Assistance for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers and Veteran Farmers and Ranchers program. The Committee requests the Secretary identify any barriers to access the program, make recommendations to improve the program and report to the Committees.    Pay Costs.--The Committee provides the full pay and FERS costs for all offices and agencies of USDA funded in this bill and FDA. Similar to prior years, the Committee does not include direct funding for USDA activities currently funded through other resources such as the Working Capital Fund or have historically been funded through other means.    Resilient Building Materials.--With increases in weather-related and other natural disasters, there is a clear need to increase resilience of the nation's buildings and infrastructure. Mass timber and other innovative wood products, when appropriately used in the construction of buildings and other infrastructure, have been shown to withstand wind, seismic, and other natural forces with robust results and the Committee acknowledges the need to include these products in any categorization of products considered to be resilient by the USDA and other federal agencies. The Committee, therefore, encourages the USDA to support programs that include the use of wood products to improve the nation's ability to withstand and recover from weather-related and other natural events.    Spending Plans.--The bill continues a provision in Title VII that requires USDA to submit spending plans to the Committee within  days of enactment. Previous versions of these plans have not included adequate details that would be useful for Committee oversight. The Committee requests that the USDA spending plans include for each program, project, or activity: () a comparison between the congressional budget justification funding levels, the most recent congressional directives or approved funding levels, and the funding levels proposed by the department or agency; and () a clear, concise, and informative description/justification. The Committee reminds USDA of notification requirements, also included in Title VII, for all applicable changes.    Livestock Gene Editing Cooperation.--As the Secretary of Agriculture develops regulations pertaining to the movement of animals modified or developed by genetic engineering, the Secretary shall consult with the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration to ensure any resulting regulations are coordinated.    Status of House and Senate Report Language.--The Department is directed to include in its fiscal year  Congressional Justification, as a single exhibit, a table listing all deliverables, with a column for due dates if applicable. OBPA is directed to provide updates on the status of House and Senate reports upon request from the Committees.    Strong working conditions for our farmworkers are critical to the resiliency of the food and agricultural supply chain. The Committee is supportive of USDA's efforts to improve working conditions for farmworkers, including for women farmworkers who are vulnerable to sexual assault and exploitation in the workplace. The Committee urges the Department to expand partnerships with appropriate entities to ensure the working conditions and challenges faced by women farmworkers are adequately investigated and incorporated into USDA's pilots and programs. The Committee requests the Department to conduct a study to ) understand the work conditions and challenges, such as sexual assault, faced by women farmworkers; and ) to develop recommendations on how the Department can promote improvements through its programs and pilots."

Indian Country Broadband.--The Committee urges the USDA to responsibly and efficiently take action to address broadband deficiencies through increased access and investments for broadband on rural Tribal lands.    Open Access.--The Committee recognizes the value of open access broadband fiber infrastructure projects as well as the challenges these projects face in qualifying for federal funding and directs the USDA Rural Utilities Service (RUS) to support financially-feasible open access infrastructure projects that meet its program goals.    ReConnect.--The Committee provides an additional  for the ReConnect program to increase access to broadband connectivity in unserved and underserved rural communities, targeting areas of the country with the largest broadband coverage gaps, including those with mountainous terrain.    ReConnect Application.--The Committee recognizes difficulties caused by supply chain disruptions can make administration of broadband projects more difficult, but encourages USDA to work to expeditiously disburse ReConnect funds once grants and loans are awarded. Additionally, the Committee encourages the Department to examine, and appropriately adjust collateral requirements in within ReConnect Loan Agreements, Grant Agreements, or Loan/Grant Agreements to ensure greater Program access.    ReConnect Coordination.--The Committee recognizes the certain burdens facing small telecommunication providers in rural America that seek financial assistance through the ReConnect program. Rural broadband providers are community institutions that are leading the way to close the digital divide. Government assistance programs should not further complicate these small companies with costly applications and confusing regulatory compliance requirements. The Committee urges the continued partnerships with other Federal agencies to review various Federal broadband program requirements in efforts to better understand program nuances and promote harmonization of Federal broadband application processes.    ReConnect Scoring Criteria.--The ReConnect program shall establish a scoring criterion that prioritizes serving the hardest to reach, unserved and underserved rural communities.    ReConnect Service Areas.--RUS Telecommunications Program funds should not be awarded in any areas, study areas or census blocks where a recipient of FCC High-Cost USF support is already subject to a buildout obligation of / Mbps or greater for fixed terrestrial broadband, except that RUS Telecommunication Program funds may be awarded in such areas to help finance construction of the network. This shall not apply in cases where the FCC has not provided for final approval of an award of such funds.    ReConnect Technical Assistance.--The committee recognizes that there is a greater need for technical assistance for small, rural communities applying for USDA loans and grants.

324,117-392 H.txt,    For the Office of the Under Secretary for Food,"    For the Office of the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services, the Committee provides an appropriation of .    Accessibility of Federal nutrition programs.--The Committee maintains its interest in increasing accessibility of Federal nutrition programs for those with culturally or religiously sensitive diets, including Kosher and Halal. The Committee recognizes efforts underway at the Department to gain a deeper understanding of existing barriers to offering more Kosher and Halal foods through these programs. The Committee embraces these efforts and urges the Department to accelerate, to the extent practicable, its exploration and implementation of strategies to overcome these barriers. The Committee directs the Secretary to provide a briefing within  days of enactment of this Act on these efforts, to include identification of any additional resources that may be necessary to implement strategies, overcome barriers, and close existing gaps in this area. Recognizing that cost to school food authorities in providing culturally and religiously sensitive meals to children participating in the Federal school meal programs is a barrier, the Committee welcomes information from the Department about potential adjustments to the school meal reimbursement rate to better account for costs of providing such meals.    Local Food.--The Committee recognizes the growing demand for locally and regionally produced food. The Committee encourages all nutrition programs, to the extent feasible, to engage local agriculture producers to enhance small farmers and regional producers. The Committee again directs FNS to review its Child Nutrition Programs and other food distribution programs to determine how many of their commodity purchases are locally sourced and how to improve procurement from local and small farmers.    Public Release of Information.--The Committee directs FNS to continue making all policy documents related to the WIC program (including, but not limited to, instructions, memoranda, guidance, and questions and answers) available to the public on the Internet within one week of their release to WIC state administrators."

Alternate Protein Meal Options.--The Committee directs FNS to collect, analyze, and publish research relating to the availability of plant-based and alternate protein meal options under USDA programs in schools and other congregate settings, and the impact of plant-based and alternate protein meal options on population health outcomes. The committee further directs the Department to provide guidance on the implementation of daily plant-based and alternate protein meal options under the NSLP and SBP for consideration by state agencies and local program operators.    Child Nutrition Waivers.--The Committee is concerned over reports of decreasing student participation in school breakfast and lunch programs despite the on-going COVID- public health crisis. The Committee is supportive of the child nutrition waivers, authorized under Section  of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, and the flexibility they provided for state child nutrition programs to meet the ongoing challenges brought on by the pandemic. The Committee looks forward to reviewing the results of the School Meal Operations Study series and to working with FNS to combat childhood hunger.    Food Waste Education.--USDA's nutrition programs reach nearly one in four Americans every day, including approximately  million children through school feeding programs. This reach provides a significant opportunity to increase public awareness of food loss and waste and ways to prevent it. The Committee encourages the USDA to include food waste education and prevention information as a priority for each of these programs and incorporate food waste prevention and reduction information into all nutrition education materials geared toward teachers, students, and other program recipients.    Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program.--The Committee appreciates the collaboration between USDA and the Department of Defense on its Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, which is available in over  states/territories and serves more than , schools. The Committee encourages DOD and USDA FNS to review current practices to identify opportunities to increase food purchases from small, medium, women and minority farmers within their respective states.    Local Food in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP).--The Committee is aware that school meals are a vital source of food and nutrition for elementary and secondary students. The Committee recognizes the NSLP could do more to support local economies and businesses through increased participation with local producers and encourages efforts to increase local food purchases for the NSLP sourced from in-state or geographically local growers and producers.    Non-dairy Milk Alternatives.--The Committee is supportive of the National School Breakfast Program and the National School Lunch Program remaining accessible to all students while maintaining its nutritional standards. As allergies may prevent children from consuming dairy-based milk, non-dairy milk alternatives may be the best option for children in school meals that achieve the intended nutrition goal. The Committee requests a briefing, not later than  days after the enactment of this Act, from FNS on the availability of non-dairy milk alternatives in school meal programs.    Summer Food Service Program.--The Committee supports FNS allowing State Agencies to enable Summer Food Service Program service institutions that serve such areas where eligible children and youth have barriers to access or limited access to a congregate feeding site to use their customary reimbursement payments to develop and implement innovative methods to deliver or otherwise make available foods to eligible children and youth by non-congregate means or in non-congregate settings.    Team Nutrition.--The Committee supports the promotion of nutritional health of school children and recognizes the need for additional support for schools to meet certain nutrition standards for school meals, particularly for sodium and whole grains. The committee encourages FNS to help schools meet whole grains and sodium-reduction targets.    The agreement provides the following for Child Nutrition Programs:"
326,117-392 H.txt,    For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,"    For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, the Committee provides an appropriation of .

The President's budget request includes a projection of an average monthly participation rate of . million women, infants, and children for fiscal year . The Committee provides funding that will ensure all eligible participants will be served and to maintain the amounts of fruits and vegetables in the WIC Food Package.    The Committee will continue to monitor WIC participation trends, carryover funds, and food costs and take additional action as necessary.    Improving Breastfeeding Rates.--The Committee remains interested in how to improve breastfeeding rates and eliminate barriers to breastfeeding for low-income and minority women. To meet their breastfeeding goals, according to the CDC, mothers need continuity of care which is achieved by consistent, collaborative, and high-quality breastfeeding services and supplies. Reports that some WIC agencies only make breast pumps and related supplies available to WIC participants who meet certain difficult criteria are concerning and seem to be in opposition to the goals of encouraging breastfeeding. Food and Nutrition Service is directed to collect information from all WIC agencies and prepare a report to the committee, within  days of enactment of this bill, detailing any conditions WIC agencies consider, or requirements they impose, when determining whether a WIC participant who intends to fully breastfeed her infant may access breastfeeding supplies and services.    Maternal Mortality Data.--The Committee remains concerned about maternal mortality and awaits the report detailed in House Report -.    WIC Food Package.--The Committee understands FNS is currently considering changes to the WIC food packages based on recommendations from the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine's (NASEM)  report in conjunction with the recently released Dietary Guidelines for Americans, - and looks forward to reviewing those changes. The committee notes repeated DGAs have identified dairy products as nutrient-dense, while also identifying a high percentage of the U.S. population, including WIC's at-risk population, as not consuming the recommended level of dairy.    Zika Outreach and Education.--The Committee encourages the Department to continue its education and outreach efforts through the WIC program to provide pregnant women with the information they need to prevent Zika."
327,117-392 H.txt,    For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,"    For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Committee provides .

The Committee also includes a such sums appropriation in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, as requested by the Administration, in case participation exceeds expected levels or there is a disaster that cannot be managed through use of the contingency funds.    Barriers to Accessing SNAP.--The Committee recognizes the Families First Coronavirus Response Act directed the Secretary of Agriculture to submit a report to Congress  months after the public health emergency ends on the measures taken to address the food security needs of affected populations during the emergency and recommendations for changes to the Secretary's authority under the Food and Nutrition Act of  to assist the Secretary and States and localities in preparations for any future health emergencies. The Committee is eager to learn about the impact of temporary SNAP related improvements during the COVID- pandemic, lessons learned. and recommendations on promoting food security during COVID- and beyond.    The Committee encourages FNS to include in this report the impacts on SNAP benefits of the expiration of the PHE and related SNAP measures, and ways to promote equitable customer service, including through language access, and alternative eligibility system access options such as in person, online, and call center availability.    College Hunger.--The Committee remains concerned that SNAP eligible students who are food-insecure lack proper information about resources available to them. Under regular SNAP eligibility requirements, students enrolled at least half time in an institution of higher education are typically ineligible for SNAP benefits unless they meet certain specific exemptions. Public Law - included provisions to temporarily expand SNAP eligibility to students. The Committee continues to direct FNS to make information available on its website regarding student SNAP eligibility requirements easier to understand and more accessible. The Committee directs FNS to report back on the number of students who enrolled in SNAP due to this increased flexibility and provide any lessons learned.    Military Food Insecurity.--The Committee recognizes that COVID- exacerbated food insecurity for millions of people, including members of the military. The Committee is also aware that the Basic Allowance for Housing that members of the military receive is not excluded as income when calculating eligibility for SNAP. The Committee supports a reevaluation and revision of this policy to reduce the number of military members relying on food banks and to ensure all members of the military have access to healthy, nutritious food.    Retailer Language Access.--The Committee supports cultural retailers participating in SNAP for their role ensuring immigrant communities have affordable access to cultural foods. Such retailers may be led by individuals with Limited English Proficiency. The Committee directs FNS to submit a plan within  days for ensuring meaningful language access when serving retailers. The plan shall include the implementation of language translation and interpretation services.    SNAP Application Reporting.--The Committee is interested in the number of approved applications, and nonapproved applications due to a drug felony conviction, a condition related to a drug felony conviction, or a time limit related to a drug felony ban for each state. The Committee is also interested in the number of total applications and incomplete or abandoned applications due, whether in whole or in part, to a drug felony conviction, a condition related to a drug felony conviction, or a time limit related to a drug felony ban for each state. The Committee recognizes FNS does not have complete information on denials related to drug felonies at the state-level, and requests a briefing, within  of enactment of this Act, to better understand the various aspects and limitations to this data collection, and the costs and timeframe for such as study.    SNAP-Ed.--When administering SNAP-Ed, the Committee encourages FNS and NIFA to prioritize evidence-based interventions that include hands-on cooking paired with nutrition education. The Committee believes that SNAP-Ed grants should include cooking programs that deliver community-based nutrition education to SNAP-eligible families with the intention of helping households maximize their food budgets and prepare healthier meals.    SNAP Integrity.--The Committee recognizes the importance of program integrity in the Department's administration of SNAP, including the distribution of benefits. While the pandemic temporarily compromised these integrity measures, including the inability for the Department to issue error rates for both FY  and FY , SNAP Quality Control returned to normal modes of data collection as of July , . With the FY  data, FNS will also return to normal modes of analysis and distribution of information.    SNAP Online Pilot Program.--The Committee supports increased flexibility for SNAP beneficiaries to use their benefits for online purchases. The Committee is concerned that barriers for entry to the program are higher for independent retailers. The committee urges USDA to continue to pursue the SNAP EBT Modernization Technical Assistance Center to assist small, independent retailers in overcoming barriers to participation in the online purchasing pilot, and to report to the committee on ways to facilitate independent retailers' participation in the pilot.    Study and Evaluation Plan.--The Committee recognizes the importance of nutritious food to the wellbeing of individuals participating in SNAP. The Committee encourages FNS to explore measuring the impact of restricting SNAP purchases to measure the impact of limiting certain SNAP purchases on healthy food choices by people participating in SNAP.    TEFAP Local Purchase.--The Committee is aware that TEFAP distributors such as foodbanks, soup kitchens, and food pantries have a natural bond with their local farmers. The Committee encourages FNS to explore innovative ways to procure food directly from small and local farmers.    Territories.--The Committee recognizes the inadequacy and inefficacy of the current Nutrition Assistance Program block grant funding for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and American Samoa, which has had to be repeatedly supplemented in response to natural disasters and the COVID- pandemic. The Committee encourages FNS to continue engaging the appropriate stakeholders and directs FNS to provide the Committee with updates on the separate plans and discussions to includes these territories in SNAP.    The agreement provides the following for SNAP:"

This includes  for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program,  for the Farmers' Market Nutrition Program,  for administrative funding for The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), and  for the Food Donations Programs for Pacific Island Assistance.    Food Bank Donations.--The Committee applauds the work that food banks and pantries have accomplished during the pandemic, including providing over  million people with much-needed sustenance and nutrition in . The Committee recognizes demand at food banks is still high, due to the pandemic and rising food costs, but food banks are no longer receiving the amount of food donations they once were from food producers. The Committee supports all efforts to assist and alleviate the burden that food banks are facing.    Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program.--The Committee recognizes the importance and success of the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition program in helping to provide support to over , low-income seniors in purchasing healthy and nutritious food options from local farmers. The Committee notes USDA invested  million in SFMNP as part of its framework to shore up the food supply chain and transform the food system. The Committee directs FNS to brief the Committee within  days of enactment on any remaining backlogs and how to improve the program and serve more eligible low-income seniors.    TEFAP Handling and Distribution Costs.--In addition to grant funds supporting commodity handling and distribution costs, the bill permits states to use up to  percent of the funds provided for purchasing TEFAP commodities to help with the costs of storing, transporting, and distributing commodities. The Committee expects state agencies to consult with their emergency feeding organizations on the need for the conversion of such funds.    Training for Handling Kosher and Halal Foods in TEFAP.--The Committee supports the inclusion of food that meets cultural and religious requirements within TEFAP. As such, the Committee encourages the Department to collaborate with Jewish and Muslim community leaders with nuanced understanding of religious practices and food safety procedures to develop training materials for participating TEFAP State agencies and/or eligible recipient agencies on the best practices for identifying, storing, transporting, and distributing certified kosher and halal food products. Not later than  days after enactment of this Act, FNS will submit a report to the Committee on their plans to develop training materials around the storage, transportation, and distribution of kosher and halal products in TEFAP."

The Committee recognizes that the Farm Credit Administration's current approach to approving these types of Farm Credit System investments on an individual basis does not meet the needs of rural communities. The Farm Credit Administration is encouraged to change its current process to create a clear, programmatic approval process which enables timely, comprehensive and cost effective rural community facilities financing packages by allowing and expediting Farm Credit System institutions' partnerships with community banks, other financial institutions, and USDA."
340,109-463 H (Part 1).txt,    For the Office of the Secretary,"    For the Office of the Secretary, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.

The Committee does not include funding for provisional reconstruction team as requested.    The Committee does not include funding for foreign service performance pay as requested.    Explanatory Notes.--The Committee appreciates receiving the detailed information provided in the Explanatory Notes prepared by the Department and relies heavily on this information when considering budget proposals. These materials have traditionally been prepared for the sole use of the Appropriations Committee in a format consistent with the organization and operation of the programs and the structure of the Appropriations Act. At the direction of the Office of Management and Budget, the Department has changed the format and content of these materials to focus on broader goals and objectives rather than the major program structure followed in the Act and in the actual conduct of the programs. For fiscal year  and future years, the Department is directed to present Explanatory Notes in a format consistent with the presentation used for the fiscal year  Budget. Any deviations from that format are to be approved in advance by the Committee.    State Office Collocation.--The Committee continues to direct that any reallocation of resources related to the collocation of state offices scheduled for  and subsequent years is subject to the Committee's reprogramming procedures. The Committee notes that no such reprogramming requests have been received to date.    Ralstonia.--The Committee notes that the Secretary of Agriculture initiated emergency actions during FY  to ensure the eradication of the disease Ralstonia solanacearum, Race , Biovar , which is of great concern to U.S. agriculture, including ornamentals growers, the potato industry, and others. The Committee strongly urges the Secretary of Agriculture to continue to use existing authority including that provided under CCC, to fund this initiative, and to establish a compensation program for persons suffering from losses as a result of the eradication and control efforts related to this disease. The Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Appropriations a report regarding the feasibility of establishing additional research and forward control programs in countries and/or regions that had been the point of origin for infected product.    Administrative Provision.--The Committee directs the Secretary to advise the Committees on Appropriations in writing of the status of all reports requested of the Department in this bill, at the time of submission of the FY  budget and quarterly thereafter.    The Committee is concerned with reports that the  north American cranberry crop, projected at nearly . million barrels, is expected to be significantly higher than  and that this could result in a significant reduction in prices paid to producers. The Committee is also aware that USDA has used its purchasing authorities in past years to help maintain prices to cranberry producers. As such, the Committee urges USDA to ensure that federal cranberry purchases in FY remain at least at current levels.    The Committee is concerned with reports that USDA's management of its inventory of surplus nonfat dry milk (NFDM) is threatening the development of the fledgling casein/milk protein concentrate manufacturing industry and may be causing additional and unnecessary costs to taxpayers. This industry depends upon the availability of federal stocks of NFDM but USDA appears to be throwing obstacles in the way of development of the industry by denying manufacturers the opportunity to bid on surplus stocks and in some cases rejecting bids even when there is only one bidder, all the while continuing to make surplus NFDM available to the Department of Defense and charitable institutions. While there are no doubt good justifications for these programs, the Committee believes that it is also vitally important that the U.S. develops a domestic casein/MPC manufacturing industry to compete effectively with imported products. As such, the Committee expects USDA to make greater efforts to meet the demands of the fledgling casein/MPC industry including fully utilizing new stocks of surplus product for this purpose as well as any existing stocks that may be available.    The Committee encourages USDA to establish a U.S. viticulture international market development program that includes a student exchange and internship program involving the Virginia and California wine industries with the goal of improving U.S. wine production and promoting the exportation of U.S. wines."

347,109-463 H (Part 1).txt,    For the Office of the Chief Financial Officer,"    For the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The Committee, in fiscal year , made permanent bill language that directs the Chief Financial Officer to actively market and expand the cross-servicing activities of the National Finance Center.    The Committee includes authority in section  of the general provisions that allows for unobligated discretionary balances transferred to the Working Capital Fund to be used for the acquisition of plant and capital equipment for the delivery of the Financial Management Modernization Initiative.    The Committee is aware that the National Finance Center's (NFC) proposal for e-payroll consolidation was rated the highest in the competition held by the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management. The Committee believes that the NFC's demonstrated ability to provide a high level of service while operating on a fee-for-service basis provides a significant opportunity to utilize a public/private partnership to provide private investment and share risk in the modernization of systems and infrastructure creation for e-payroll.

There is concern that this directive has not been achieved. The Committee directs that a report be provided with respect to what steps are and will be taken to meet this directive. The goal of the program is to establish a program in Ohio to foster the development of a state-wide aquaculture industry. Research conducted under this program has provided science-based information on optimal fertilization regimens for yellow perch, tested size-grading strategies that may improve production efficiency, and results of sensory comparisons of farm-raised to wild-caught yellow perch concluded that farm-raised yellow perch compares favorably to wild-caught perch. Research using methods developed in the beef industry were used to determine if there are unique protein expression patterns that are correlated with specific traits that can be used to examine muscle in fish. In studies on yellow perch muscle proteins, five muscle proteins associated with body weight and nine muscle proteins associated with body length were identified. These proteins are currently undergoing primary sequence analysis for protein characterization. This information will be useful in identifying gene products unique to enhanced muscle growth and development and will allow for producers to develop useful breeding strategies for the production of yellow perch. The latest accomplishments report included information on the genetic trials on yellow perch. Preliminary data from studies looking at  strains of yellow perch for a selective breeding program, seem to show that a strain of yellow perch from North Carolina may perform better than others in aquaculture situations. In conjunction with collaborators at Washington State University, muscle satellite cells from yellow perch have been isolated and preserved. This is the first report of the establishment of isolated muscle satellite cells from yellow perch.

Thus, the total amount contributed to this project from non-federal sources is more than .    PM- Study.--The Committee provides  for the PM- study in Washington. The goals of this research are to measure the PM- emission rates from significant crop and tillage practices, to determine the source of PM- emissions on soils in agricultural regions of the Columbia River Basin in the Pacific Northwest, and to explore cost-effective alternative agricultural practices to control these emissions. More recently, studies of finer PM-. particulates have been included because of their recognized potential health risks. Studies in the Columbia River Basin are being conducted in Washington on a number of agricultural practices in the rain-fed and dryland croplands. Susceptible climatic and soil conditions and tillage and cropping practices have been identified and are being used to develop prediction tools to assist growers to adopt alternative practices to reduce potential air pollution by PM- and PM-. particulate emissions. Direct seeding practices are also being tested for their efficacy in reducing dust emissions from wind erosion. Sixteen subprojects are currently funded by this project and a few of their accomplishments follow. PM- emission predictive maps based on soils databases and measured erodibility indices have been produced and used to modify USDA Conservation Reserve program eligibility. These data are also very useful for determining relative emissions for regional modeling work. Identification has been made of the mechanism by which Columbia Plateau soils erode during high wind events. Research has shown that direct suspension rather than saltation-induced sand blasting--common to many soils--was responsible for emission of PM--sized particles for significant parts of the Columbia Plateau region. Events of elevated PM- caused by wind erosion of the Columbia Plateau were not associated with increased mortality in Spokane. Post-harvest weed ecology approaches and how to manage them to conserve soil water and control wind erosion have been developed. Estimates have been made of anthropogenic rates in comparison to non-anthropogenic rates of wind erosion that demonstrate the potential impact farming practices can have on dust deposition. Economics of various cropping systems at the producer level have been fairly well documented from the longer-term projects such that producers can make informed decisions pertaining to the adoption of alternative farming practices. The Northwest Columbia Plateau PM- Project Annual Conference has been held annually since the beginning of the project as a means of communication between researchers, extension educators, and stakeholders. The conference provides an opportunity to report on research results and also receive feedback from other scientists and stakeholders. This two-way communication is extremely valuable to both parties as a means to help understand research and also design future research. In California, the program was matched by State funds in the form of salaries, benefits, and operating costs. In Washington, there were no state or non-Federal funds in support of the PM- project in  and . In , state support was  and in , state support was . Similar funding was continued in  through .

This research and technology-transfer initiative was created to form a Federal/state partnership that is: () characterizing odor, odorous gases, particulate matter, and green house gases from open-lot CAFO's; () developing and evaluating cost-effective abatement measures; () providing a sound, scientific basis for specific air pollution regulations, including appropriate emission factors for particulates, odor, and odorous gases for the Southern Great Plains; () determining the potential impact of these air contaminants on animal health and productivity with inferences related to human health concerns; and () providing technology transfer to the public and agricultural producers. The following are accomplishments to date by objective.    Objective . Emissions Characterizations. Multi-agency field sampling was conducted at a , head cattle feedlot in spring and summer  and . Hydrogen sulfide--HS--concentrations were  orders of magnitude lower than ammonia--NH-concentrations. Diurnal patterns were observed for both HS and NH emissions, which varied with temperature. Both flux gradient/micromet and surface isolation flux chamber approaches were used with acceptable agreement. Simulated runoff holding pond surfaces produced low ammonia emissions. NH emissions observed with flux chambers were much higher within  hours after urine deposition, as compared to a relatively dry feedlot surface.    Objective . Abatement Measures. Weight-drop test chambers--WDTC--produced regression relationships between vertical energy imparted on simulated dry feedlot surfaces and PM- emissions in relation to manure depth and moisture content, with  depth and  percent surface moisture appearing to be potential threshold areas for PM- reduction. Horizontal mode of hoof activity will be simulated in future WDTC experiments. Record -month rainfall totals reduced field work on water curtain experiments. A surface applied urease inhibitor did not produce a significant reduction in NH emissions in a field scale experiment. Evaporation rate from a feedlot surface was - percent or less of overall grass-reference Evapotranspiration (ET), depending on temperature and other climatic variables, and hygroscopic absorption at night.    Objective . Scientific Basis of Emission Factors. Protocols were improved for particulate matter (PM) measurement, using co-located PM- and total suspended particles (TSP) samplers along with particle size distribution. A Gaussian (ISCST) model provided accurate results for predicting PM- emissions from downwind concentrations, but a BLS model predicted -fold higher emissions when used conjunctively with the ISCST model. Peak PM- and TSP concentrations in summer evenings were - times daytime concentrations, being accentuated by low-level inversions along with diurnal peaks of aggressive cattle activity. Development of refined emission factors for cattle feedyards and dairies is progressing, including a road dust component.    Objective . Animal Health. Ventilated calf exposure chambers to produce controlled concentrations of feedyard dust are nearly complete for a graduate student research project. Particle agglomeration in lung fluids is being examined as a potential mitigation factor in cattle exposure to feedlot PM.    Objective . Technology Transfer. A research peer review with industry participation was conducted with positive, constructive feedback for project focus. Coinvestigators produced  manuscripts, and made  scientific presentations.    Non-federal matching funds for this proposal were estimated at  for fiscal year ;  identified in ,  reported in ,  in .    Animal disease.--The Committee provides  for animal disease research in Wyoming. The goal of this program when initiated in  was to better understand the epidemiology and transmission of chronic wasting disease in free-ranging deer. Since initiated in , the researchers have successfully identified chronic wasting disease-positive free-ranging deer in southeastern Wyoming. Data from these positive deer are still being analyzed for dispersal rates, migration patterns, survival rates, home range size, habitat use, daily activity patterns, and interaction of deer with cattle. Studies have also been expanded to characterize the impact of West Nile virus on greater sage-grouse in Wyoming. Data from this study confirms that West Nile virus may cause localized population declines or possibly localized extinctions in greater sage-grouse, and it was determined that the range-wide implications of West Nile virus in sage-grouse require more intensive and longer-term study. In fiscal year , a total of  was contributed by the University of Wyoming, Wyoming Game and Fish Department, and other state appropriations. In fiscal year , a total of  was contributed by other universities and miscellaneous sources.

The goals were to bring together several universities to provide research that is relevant to food safety. The Consortium focus continues to be methods of development for the isolation, detection, and quantification of microbial and chemical hazards and the elimination of those hazards. This research has also resulted in the expansion of research into risk assessment, economics, policy, and trade. The food safety work has enabled the consortium to address food security that may be a result of bioterrorism and/or natural disasters. Iowa State University is also supporting in the coming year an integrated risk and cost-based analysis of salmonella in the pork production chain. This project will suggest the segments of the pork production, processing, and delivery process where salmonella may be controlled most effectively, and the points at which control is cost-effective. The non-federal funds and sources provided for this project are as follows: fiscal year , ; fiscal year , ; fiscal year , ; and fiscal year , .    Aquaculture (LA).--The Committee provides  for aquaculture in Louisiana. The goal of the research was to provide science-based information that specifically addressed the needs of the aquaculture industry in Louisiana and the Southern region. Over the years, the Aquaculture, Louisiana, program has led to advances in new stocking, culture, and harvest techniques for commercial crawfish production. New processing technologies for crawfish, catfish, and other aquaculture products have also been developed improving food quality and safety. Genetics research has led to the development of gene maps for commercial strains of channel catfish and has improved cryopreservation techniques for genetic banking of commercially-important aquaculture species. New, least-cost feed formulations that meet the nutritional needs of aquaculture species has led to reductions in feed costs. Recent accomplishments under this program have improved crawfish harvest efficiency through the use of improved winter baits, the use of square-mesh traps during harvest, and through the use of non-traditional pond-draining schedules. Additionally, there have been improvements made in disease control by the development of new vaccines for channel catfish. The university estimates that non-federal funding for this program is as follows:  in fiscal year ;  in fiscal year ; and approximately  in nonfederal support was made available in support of this project in fiscal year . The university estimates that  in non-federal support was made available for projects outlined in the FY  submission coming primarily from state funds.    Biomass-based energy research.--The Committee provides  for biomass-based energy research in Oklahoma and Mississippi. The primary goal is to develop a cost-effective biomass conversion-to-ethanol production system utilizing a unique gasification-fermentation process. Breeding efforts for bermudagrass and switchgrass as energy crops have resulted in genetic improvement and new cultivar development. Additional biomass feedstocks such as cotton gin waste and sawdust have been processed to evaluate handling and storage, material composition, and synthesis gas yield and quality. Two gasifiers, a fluidized-bed reactor and a downdraft unit, have been optimized using switchgrass, bermudagrass, and corn fermentation waste as inputs. The bioreactor is ready to scale up to  liters, and an optimal growth medium for the biocatalyst has been formulated for cell growth. Optimization of trace metals for a second biocatalyst to be evaluated resulted in an increase of over  percent in ethanol production in routine culture. An economic analysis to determine the potential economies of scale from a coordinated biorefinery operation focused on harvesting and handling. Combined, the Oklahoma and Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Stations provide over  per year. Aventine Renewable Energy, Incorporated, formerly Williams Bio-Energy, committed a total of  through fiscal year .

Exotic pest diseases.--The Committee provides  for exotic pest diseases in California. The goal of this research is to improve the prevention and management of exotic pests and diseases affecting California's agricultural, urban, and natural systems. The long-term goal of the grants program is to develop a systematic methodology for dealing with exotic pests in risk assessment; early detection; and rapid development of control or eradication measures leading to improved Integrated Pest Management practices through biological, microbial, genetic, and chemical practices. Because a new exotic pest enters California every  days, the challenge is to have current scientific information available to prevent these introduced pests from becoming established. The project aims to establish a strategic, collaborative research approach to support urgently needed exclusion and prevention programs for potential introductions and proven management and eradication methods for established pests. To date,  research projects are yielding scientific knowledge on targeted pest species and to develop methods to control and manage the pests that are already in California or those species that pose a real threat to the State. In previous years, California commodity boards funded approximately  annually in research on invasive species; and the State of California funded approximately  annually in fruit fly research. Currently, California commodity boards are funding approximately  on invasive species research and  million for research on Pierce's Disease. The State of California and the University of California are funding approximately  in invasive species research.    Feedstock conversion.--The Committee provides  for feedstock conversion in South Dakota. The goal of this research was to develop the mission of the Sun Grant Initiative, to identify five leading universities as regional centers, to plan individual and collaborative activities at each center, and to establish a working relationship between these universities and Federal agencies. A nation-wide series of planning conferences and stakeholder input sessions have been conducted by each of five Centers. A report on these activities has been prepared, illustrating the widespread support and commitment to the Sun Grant Initiative, even from non-member institutions. Development of regional academic programs involving multiple institutions has been initiated, with curriculum planned on bio-based products and bio-energy. Regional assessments of available and current curriculum took place, as well as an analysis and projection of past, present, and future fuel use. The key project leaders actively involved in enhancing networking within industries by helping to plan, and participating in, several professional and trade organization meetings. No non-federal funds have been identified for the purposes of this special grant.    Food and Agriculture Policy Institute.--The Committee provides  for the Food and Agriculture Policy Institute in Iowa and Missouri. The goal was to develop the analytical capability to assess and evaluate U.S. farm policies on the U.S. agricultural sector and disseminate this information to farmers, farm and other agricultural organizations, and public policymakers. The mission has been expanded to include assessment of trade and environmental policy impacts and their interaction with the agricultural sector at national, regional, and farm levels. The models in place are also used to assess fiscal and monetary policy implications and impacts of new technologies such as biotechnological innovations on the agricultural sector. Both institutions maintain large econometric models and datasets which are regularly updated to analyze farm and trade policy alternatives and the impacts of various programs on the several sub sectors of the agricultural economy. During the past year, the FAPRI prepared the final agricultural projections on world agricultural production, consumption, and trade. Major drivers of the  baseline include continuing strong economic growth world wide, recovery from past weather shocks in key producing countries, recent SPS shocks, and the U.S. dollar's weakness in industrialized countries and its strength in Latin America. An outside review, re-evaluation of projections, and completion of the final baseline is also prepared. These final projections for domestic and world agricultural markets are found in the FAPRI  U.S. and World Agricultural Outlook. FAPRI projections assume average weather patterns worldwide, existing policy, and policy commitments under current trade agreements. FAPRI projections do not include conjectures on potential policy changes, such as those resulting from the likely accession of China to the World Trade Organization. The FAPRI staff has made numerous public appearances throughout the U.S. to agricultural groups and Congressional committees and Executive branch groups addressing policy issues.

The USDA Global Change/Ultraviolet Monitoring and Research Network was designed to provide accurate, geographicallydispersed data on ultraviolet radiation reaching the surface of the earth and to detect trends over time. Instruments have been deployed and are currently in operation at  monitoring sites across the United States and Canada, including Hawaii and Alaska, and a site in New Zealand which is located under the Antarctic ozone hole during part of the year. Data from these sites are available within  hours of collection via the Web. The United States Department of Agriculture is also a participant in the development of a central calibration facility at the Department of Commerce facilities in Boulder, Colorado. The purpose of the central calibration facility is to ensure uniform and acceptable calibration and characterization of all instruments used in interagency ultraviolet monitoring programs. Some project funds are expended each year to partially support studies by collaborators across the country to address plant, animal, and ecological impacts from ultraviolet exposure. This, of course, represents a small fraction of all the scientific studies being conducted with these data by the broader scientific community. No non-federal funds have been provided for this grant since .    Human nutrition (IA).--The Committee provides  for human nutrition in Iowa. Researchers have found that the activity of soy sphingolipids in inhibiting cancer can be modulated by genetics and processing techniques. The omega- fatty acid content of walleye fillets was increased by feeding the fish non-marine lipids. PCBs were below detectable limits in the walleye fillets. The fillets with enhanced concentrations of omega- fatty acids do not have undesirable sensory attributes and were not more rancid after more than six months of freezer storage. Studies have demonstrated that resveratrol aglycone in grapes is active in the cell cycle arrest of colon cancer cells. Finally, investigators have determined the accessibility of rural elderly to fresh fruits, vegetables, high quality protein foods, and dietary supplements, examining the social and economic barriers to these important nutrients. They are formulating a public policy framework and conducting analyses to be used to better understand current food consumption patterns, their relationship to performance and health, and the development and evaluation of new policies and regulations which relate to changes in new technologies for foods.The non-federal funds and sources provided for this grant were as follows:  university and  private and state sources in ; and  university and  private and state sources in ; and  University and  private and state sources in .

The source and amount of non-federal funds are as follows: in fiscal year ,  from industry and the State of Michigan; in fiscal year ,  from industry; and iIi fiscal year ,  from industry. There were no direct nonfederal funds in support of the project in fiscal year .    Nevada arid rangelands initiative.--The Committee provides  for the Nevada arid rangelands initiative. The goal of this research was to develop research management and educational programs to promote healthy productive and sustainable use of Nevada rangeland. The project is based on four program goals, which were identified in partnership with rural communities and families and in consultation with other agencies and organizations with range concerns. The goals are: healthy rangeland for multiple uses; improved campus based education; healthy ranch, community, and county; and public land decision support models. A survey of pigmy rabbit population showed that they are present in much of the historical range, and an Endangered Species designation is not needed. Considerable progress has been made in range weed control, assessment of pinyon-juniper expansion and range management/wildlife interaction. The estimate for non-federal funds provided for this program from state funds by fiscal years: , ; , ; , ; , ; and , . The non-federal support for this project in  has been estimated at . In addition, a large number of state and Federal agencies and non-governmental organizations are cooperating with this project. Their contributions are not reflected in these estimates and are accounted for in their own projects.    Oyster post-harvest treatment.--The Committee provides  for oyster post-harvest treatment in Florida. The goal of this research was to increase the options and capacity for post-harvest treatments that can be used to reduce health risks associated with the consumption of raw oysters commercially processed in Florida. Recent program focus has been to develop and advance commercial use, regulatory recognition, and buyer confidence in freezing as an effective post-harvest process to reduce and eliminate problematic bacteria in oysters destined for raw consumption. A progress update for the approval of the use of irradiation in seafood was obtained from the National Fisheries Institute and the Federal Drug Administration's--FDA--Office of Pre-market Approval. In addition, contact has been established with SUREBEAM Corporation to obtain the cost of treating the product or to install a new treatment facility. Recently, technical trials are suggesting that irradiation could reduce potential pathogens from raw shellfish, but there are resulting concerns for subsequent product shelf-life, operational costs, and regulatory approvals that could restrict use of this technology. Specific accomplishments include: an active steering committee with participation from industry, government, and academia has been established; an industry survey has been conducted that documents compliance with the Federal mandates for program capacity goals; the steering committee and industry have compiled and discussed the different post-harvest technologies alternatives that are available and concluded that freezing, whole and halfshell oysters, was the best alternative for Florida. A new product developed from this research includes FROSTED Oysters. Past accomplishments have conducted surveys to document post-harvest treatment capacity in the Florida oyster industry; a validation protocol for the use of freezing as a post-harvest treatment has been developed and sent to the FDA, the International Shellfish Sanitation Commission, and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services' representatives for comment; and commercially-frozen oysters were evaluated to determine organoleptic characteristics. Non-federal funds used in support of this program in fiscal year  were  coming primarily from state and industry sources. Non-federal funding supporting this project has not been made available to the agency.    Pierce's disease.--The Committee provides  for Pierce's disease in CA. The initial goal of the research was to control the spread of the glassy-winged sharpshooter in order to slow the spread of the disease. However, controlling the insect alone will not solve the problem in the long term. The over-arching goal of the research is to learn how to control the disease, preferably through the development of resistant grape clones, supplemented with integrated management methods. The total non-federal contribution to this project for fiscal year  through  is approximately  million. These funds are coming from the State of California, the viticultural industry in California, the Citrus Research Board and Almond Board of California and Kern and Tulare Counties, with the California Department of Food and Agriculture have all contributed funds.    Regional barley gene mapping project.--The Committee provides  for the regional barley gene mapping project in Oregon. The goal of this project has been to increase the profitability and sustainability of barley production. Specific goals are to develop a molecular map for important barley traits and provide molecular markers for barley breeders. The major accomplishment of this project in  was the result of the fundamental tools and resources for barley genetics it has developed. These resources, the cumulative product of collaborative research in this project, were essential for securing one of only two highly competitive and prestigious USDA/CSREES Coordinated Agricultural Project awards, also known as a ``CAP'' award, in . As indicated by the title of the successful project, ``Leveraging genomics, genetics, and breeding for gene discovery and barley improvement'', the award has leveraged every component of this project--from providing the seed money for development of the Barley Gene Chip to pioneering genetic mapping and dissection of quantitative traits. Over the next five years, the Barley CAP award will fund a national, coordinated effort to apply the latest genetic technologies, developed by this project, to barley variety development. The present project will continue to support complementary development of the tools and knowledge necessary for the next generation of progress.The non-federal funds and sources provided for this grant were as follows:  from industry in ;  from industry in ;  from industry in ;  from industry in ; and  from the State of Washington and  in other non-federal funding, for a total of  in ;  for ;  for ; for , ; for , ; for , ; for , ; for ,  from industry; and for ,  from industry, specifically from Anheuser-Busch, Inc.

Rural Policies Institute.--The Committee provides  for the Rural Policies Institute in Nebraska, Iowa, and Missouri. The goal of the Rural Policy Research Institute was to create a new model for providing timely, unbiased estimates of the impacts of policies and new policy initiatives on rural people and places. That model was developed. Policy analysis research and dissemination activities expanded in response to current and emerging issues in rural America. RUPRI facilitates panels of researchers who collaborate on topical areas and form the fabric of its research capacity. Their research is published and cited in academic journals, discussed in the media, and used by policy decision makers at all levels of government. In  RUPRI hosted one international conference and Fellows program and six national conferences; participated in nine hearing or briefing testimonies at the national, regional, or state level; and published over  policy studies, white papers and working papers. The international conference was held in Abingdon, Virginia, and built on three previous conferences to emphasize the sharing of education, culture, and environment across nations with attention to implications for rural policy and governance. Over  people from  countries participated. RUPRI Fellows traveled to Brussels to study European Union policy in agriculture and rural development. Nationally, RUPRI provided organizational leadership for the National Rural Network, a consortium of  national organizations, institutions, and non-governmental entities working to create a framework for national rural policy. It also hosted a Rural Regional Innovation Policy Dialogue to build a common platform for rural development initiatives. Regionally, RUPRI began a Community Clustering Initiative, with funding from the Northwest Area Foundation, to strengthen governance in multi-community regions of the northwest. State level activities included a meeting of State Rural Policy Centers to study on-going initiatives, co-hosting the second annual Rural Policy Academy for state legislators, and collaboration on a Missouri Rural Entrepreneurship Initiative. It continued working in the areas of entrepreneurship, health policy, telecommunications, and poverty amelioration. It conducted six Home town Competitiveness Academies and eight Energizing Entrepreneurship Workshops. In , RUPRI reconfigured its work in poverty and rural health to establish its Rural Human Services and Poverty Policy Center and formed a Rural Human Services National Advisory Committee.Aggregated non-federal funds to support RUPRI across the three involved universities include indirect costs, salary support from university and other non-federal sources, and various other grants, contracts, and reimbursable agreements. They amounted to  for fiscal year ;  for fiscal year ; and  for fiscal year .    Small fruit research.--The Committee provides  for small fruit research in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. The goal of this research was the genetic improvement of small fruit cultivars to enhance quality, yield, and marketability. This grant supports research using genetic material from national germplasm collections and the discovery of new isolates, which expand these genetic holdings. Studies supported by this project use advanced selections in breeding programs and approaches that utilize genetic engineering. Another industry wide-goal of this program is to identify new potentially harmful virus disorders in nursery stock and eliminate them prior to introduction into small fruit production systems. The selection and development of new small fruit varieties is essential to maintaining the competitiveness of the United States in the world market and in maintaining export advantages required for our international balance of trade. The Federal investment in this program leverages an additional  percent of additional funding from research investments contributed by the private sector. Annual combined contributions range from  to . Following peer review and grant ranking this project will fund the highest ranked proposals until the program's grant dollars are exhausted. Commodity groups and grower associations then review the remaining unfunded proposals and use their non-Federal resources to fund additional research based upon their commodities specific research needs.    Sustainable beef supply.--The Committee provides  for sustainable beef supply in Montana. The Montana Beef Network has three primary objectives: () develop and implement certification programs for feeder calves that have met beef quality assurance management protocols; () provide information from the feedlot and packing plant to the cow-calf producer to determine if feeder calves met industry requirements for quality, consistency, and yield of red meat; and () provide educational programs aimed at sharing results of research projects and methods to meet beef quality assurance standards with beef producers in Montana. To date, more than , producers are certified through the Beef Quality Assurance Program; more than , calves were enrolled in  for source verification, age verification, and tracking carcass data; educational programs and hands-on demonstrations of animal identification were conducted throughout Montana; a website was developed for sharing information; and a newsletter was distributed in August through December of each year.

In fiscal year , the National Cattlemen's Beef Association contributed .    Tillage, silviculture, waste management.--The Committee provides  for tillage, siviculture, and waste management in Louisiana. The goal of this grant was to improve conservation tillage systems for Louisiana crops and to address manure issues from dairy and poultry operations. This project has improved local methods of conservation tillage to control erosion for cotton, corn, wheat, and rice, as well as managing insect pests with the increased crop stubble under the warm, humid local conditions. Pollution from poultry has been managed by modifying the diet with phytase and virginiamycin to reduce phosphorus outputs and identify alternative manure uses on forage grasses and loblolly pine plantations. Dairy manure is being managed with solids separation and aerobic digestion to reduce E. coli pathogens and improve nutrient management. Research projects were supported by non-federal funds in the amount of .    Water use efficiency and water quality enhancements.--The Committee provides  for water use efficiency and water quality enhancements in Georgia. The goal of this research is to develop and expedite the implementation of new technologies to improve water use efficiency and water quality at both a state and watershed scale. Detailed information on three variable rate irrigation systems was collected on three Georgia farms, and water quality data on several sites has been collected with the goal of optimizing yield, water quality, and field cropping patterns with a minimum of water use. The project has developed and aided in the commercialization of a first generation commercial variable rate center pivot system and  of these have been installed with a  percent reduction in water consumption and improved crop productivity. Design of a next generation sensing system using wireless internet tools and solar power is complete, and work on integrating the sensors with the pivot controller is underway. Water quality monitoring has been installed on several sites, and results of a dissertation funded by this project have lead to recommendations for riparian buffers as crucial landscape Best Management Practices for reducing herbicide runoff from agricultural production on Georgia's coastal plain. In fiscal year , approximately  was provided in non-federal matching funds. These funds were contributed by state agencies and non-profit organizations.

Wood utilization.--The Committee provides  for wood utilization in Oregon, Mississipi, North Carolina, Minnesota, Maine, Michigan, Idaho, Tennessee, Alaska, and West Virginia. There were two goals in the original grant: () provide science that addresses the problems associated with harvesting, transporting, manufacturing, and marketing economical forest products in three regions, and () educate graduate students to be knowledgeable in wood as a renewable resource. The program has been expanded to include additional university research locations. These have included new regions of indigenous forests and specific manufacturing techniques. The following are new accomplishments with their impacts:University of Alaska    . Issue. Restructuring of the forest products industry by supporting efforts to develop new markets, processing technology, and value added products in order to stimulate the economy and create more jobs in rural Alaska.    . Response: Sponsored a demonstration project on marketing a high-value wood product, Umbrella Swift, a specialty item used to detangle yarn. Marketing was done using tradeshows, journal ads, and the World Wide Web.    . Impact. Gross sales of the company increased by  percent over the course of the project and valuable information was gained on what type of marketing worked and what did not.University of Minnesota, Duluth    . Issue. The United States forest products industry is facing tremendous competitive pressures from global competition and increased raw material costs.    . Response: Lean manufacturing production simulations, educational training and project facilitation programs have been developed and implemented to promote global competitiveness and sustainable growth for over  small and medium wood products manufacturers in Minnesota and across the Midwest United States.    . Impact. Productivity improvements of - percent, cost reductions of - percent, and lead time reductions of - percent, with a financial impact of over .Mississippi State University    . Issue. Need to create a new inventory of Mississippi forests and quantify the economic impacts of the state's forest products industry, and improved the performance of timber harvesting firms and mills.    . Response: The MSU Department of Forestry pursued research to provide quantitative data.    . Impact. Research yielded a map of the state's forests to support a new inventory, improved the performance of timber harvesting firms--actually preventing two from going out of business for a loss of  jobs--, and reduced the need for mills to build more wood storage facilities, with a total economic impact of  million.    . Issue. Enable furniture manufacturers to increase their competitiveness through improving the rational design of furniture frames and durable performance of their products.    . Response: Evaluate and design computer based finite element modeling techniques and provide details on performance of structural components.    . Impact. Implementation of this technology by a furniture manufacturer would save upwards of  million annually.North Carolina State University    . Issue. Need to improve competitiveness of furniture manufacturing.    . Response: Developed and transferred technology for high speed manufacturing to U.S. based upholstered furniture manufacturers.    . Impact. Several millions of dollars in increased revenue for U.S. based furniture manufacturers that would have otherwise been lost to overseas competition and enabled upholstered furniture manufacturers to continue to employ thousands of workers.University of Idaho, University of Montana, Washington State University    . Issue. Lignin is the second most abundant organic compound on earth and is currently a highly underutilized natural resource and industrial byproduct. Among the many research steps taken toward new practical lignin applications is one involving the chemical modification of lignin to form processable thermoplastics. Such lignin-based materials could potentially be used as a direct substitute for petroleum based plastics.    . Response: This preliminary research addressed the esterification reactions of kraft and agricultural-hydrolysis lignins, the byproducts of the kraft paper-making process and of ethanol production, respectively. These lignins were reacted with acetic, propanoic, butyric, and hexanoic acid anhydrides to form their respective lignin esters. The chemical structures of the resulting compounds were analyzed using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy--lH-NMR--, diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy--DR-FTIR--, and pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry--GC-MS. Thermal transitions were detected using differential scanning calorimetry--DSC--and dynamic rheology.    . Impact. The results showed that kraft lignin was easily modified by esterification into thermally processable plastics. However, successful modification of the agricultural lignins has proven more difficult due to their highly condensed structure. The effect of phenolation--to selectively depolymerize lignin--prior to esterification of the lignins is being examined as a possible solution to these difficulties. Results also showed that the lignin ester thermal properties can be controlled by simple changes in esterification reaction parameters. Future work will look at the mechanical properties of the materials using dynamic mechanical analysis--DMA.    . Issue. According to forest inventory data, grand fir--Abies grandis--is a predominant species in the forests of the Inland Northwest region. Western Wood Products Association statistics show that grand fir lumber represented approximately  percent--approximately one billion board feet--of all softwood lumber produced in the region in . At sawmills within the region, grand fir lumber is considered one of the most difficult species to dry. Drying times are often more than  hours, energy consumption is high, and variable moisture content--pieces above the  percent MC grade specification--in dried lumber is common.    . Response: Eighteen-hundred grand fir--Abies grandis--studs were kiln dried to determine effects of high-temperature drying and restraint on drying time, energy consumption, warp--bow, crook, and twist--, and moisture content variability. The results showed that a high-temperature drying schedule-- degrees F--consumed approximately one-half the energy of a lower-temperature drying schedule typically used within the region and that drying time was cut in half. In addition, moisture variability and warp within high temperature dried lumber were no worse than in lumber dried with the conventional schedule. Results also showed that when restraint was added, warp in lumber dried with the high-temperature schedule was reduced in the top six courses of the stack.    Results of this research were presented at the Inland Northwest Kiln Drying Workshop at the University of Idaho during October . Operators and supervisors of  dry-kilns attended the workshops and represented large and small lumber manufacturers in Idaho, Washington, and Montana.    . Impact. This research has already benefited sawmills within the Inland Northwest region. Two sawmills have adopted this technology, and they have realized a  billion Btu savings in natural gas and wood energy per year which represents approximately  percent of all energy used at those plants. This is enough energy to heat and cool approximately , homes in Minneapolis for one year. Additionally, the long drying times for grand fir lumber at many of these mills create a ``bottleneck'' at the dry kilns. Operations and production at these sawmills could be improved with the use of high-temperature drying of grand fir lumber.    As a result of the  Inland Northwest Kiln Drying Workshop, two large lumber manufacturers--Riley Creek Lumber and Stimpson Lumber--plan to use hightemperature drying of grand fir lumber. These companies manufacture a large proportion of the lumber in North Idaho. Energy savings could be increased by ten times the equivalent of . million cubic meters mentioned above. This is enough energy to heat and cool approximately , homes in Minneapolis for one year.West Virginia University    . Issue. The feasibility of stranding oak residues--slash from logging--was studied to see if a strand could be produced that would be acceptable for use in manufacturing oriented strand board-OSB--and if a method could be created to manufacture strands in commercial volumes.    . Response: It was found that the stranding process needed to be significantly modified to produce oak strands with characteristics compatible with industry standards. Eventually, West Virginia University produced a stranding configuration that did create acceptable strands and are now working to modify one existing strander at the Weyerhaeuser Flatwoods OSB mill to this configuration for a full scale production test.    . Impact. The dollar impact of this portion of research could be significant if the full scale production effort proves successful. Oak residues are widely available across the state of West Virginia and have no current value as furnish for OSB mill. The addition of oak residue as a raw material source for OSB would increase the value of oak residue -fold to landowners and loggers, while increasing the supply and lowering the overall cost of raw material to the mills, resulting in several million dollars in economic impact annually in West Virginia. This technology is also exportable to other parts of the Appalachian region and would have similar impact in states with OSB mills.University of Tennessee    . Issue. New process monitoring technology is needed to improve manufacturing efficiency of wood products, enhancing the competitive position of the industry in the face of globalization.    . Response: A genetic algorithm/neural network--GANN--system was developed to predict the physical properties of wood composites. The GANN system was validated at one medium density fiberboard--MDF--and one OSB plant.    . Impact. Use of the GANN system at the MDF test site resulted in a cost savings of  over a six-month period in  due to reduced resin consumption. Validation is ongoing to assess impacts on further savings from reduced wood waste, faster throughput, and lower energy use.University of Maine    Research at the University of Maine supported by Wood Utilization Research funding on optimizing oxygen delignification for use with high lignin pulps has been implemented commercially. A major paper company in Maine has invested  in new equipment, based on the experimental results, that significantly improved the bleaching process leading to a  percent reduction in bleaching cost and a reduction in chlorinated organics and chemical oxygen demand (COD) going to the wastewater treatment plant.

365,109-463 H (Part 1).txt,    For Extension Activities,"    For Extension Activities, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  over the amount available for fiscal year  and an increase of  above the budget request.    The following table reflects the amount provided by the Committee:    Farm Safety: AgrAbility.--Within the funds provided for Smith-Lever (d) for Farm Safety, the Committee recommends  for the AgrAbility program, which helps people with disabilities to be able to farm safely, efficiently, and profitably through on-the-farm education and assistance.    Ag in the classroom.--The Committee provides  for Ag in the classroom. In , USDA initiated this program in response to the declining numbers of persons engaged in farming. USDA urged governors to convene small groups of state leaders knowledgeable about education and agriculture to develop recommendations and committees that would address methods for helping educate the public about agriculture. Over the years, Agriculture in the Classroom program activities have become focused on incorporating agriculture into core classroom curricula and educating teachers about the effectiveness of agriculture's use as a teaching tool. Since the target audience is persons with little knowledge about agriculture, Agriculture in the Classroom staff stress the usefulness of the activities to teach core curricula. Over the years, program staff have received numerous comments from workshop participants and teachers stating that they view agriculture differently, and always more positively, since becoming involved with Agriculture in the Classroom. State Agriculture in the Classroom program raise their own funds for individual program operation. These funds are from a number of sources. Some programs are state or university funded, others operate through farming organizations, and some are independently funded. Additionally, many state programs seek grants for additional program areas or raise their own funds through fund raising activities.    Alabama Beef Connection.--The Committee provides  for the Alabama Beef Connection. This program was originally designed to create a cattle marketing and communications framework for Alabama beef cattle producers. The number of beef cattle tracked through the Alabama Beef Connection has steadily increased since the project was initiated in fiscal year . More than , calves have been enrolled in the program and are currently in feedlots. Thus far, carcass data have been obtained from about  percent of the cattle enrolled in the program. The carcass data from fiscal years  and  indicated that the average USDA yield and quality grade of carcasses from Alabama calves is not different than the current average of the beef industry in the United States. In addition, more than  county/regional producer meetings,  state meetings, and  national meetings were conducted to share information with beef producers regarding premises identification and individual identification of beef cattle. In fiscal years  and , approximately  per year from state funding and  per year from Alabama beef producers were provided for this project. In fiscal year , approximately  was provided by state funding and the Alabama beef producers for this program.    Dairy education.--The Committee provides  for dairy education in Iowa. The original goals of this program were to retain and grow the business of existing dairy farm families, foster the development of new--beginning--family dairy operations, recruit dairy families from other regions to Northeast Iowa, improve the image of the dairy industry, and support specialized dairy production and processing. These goals were to be realized by providing educational opportunities for current and future dairy industry participants; conducting applied research and demonstration that impacts the regional dairy industry; add value to milk and dairy products; be an advocate for the dairy farm family; provide training in production systems that provide environmental protection and enhancement; provide assistance for intergenerational transfers; provide educational opportunities for youth; and finally, be a community resource for economic development. Several demonstrations and research trials of practical importance to the dairy industry have been conducted or are in progress at the Center. Topics include Johne's disease, calfhood vaccinations, calf starter and accelerated calf growth, multiple milkings in early lactation, zero dry day periods, mastitis in purchased cows, barrier teat dips, and tails vs. docked tails in lactating cows. The Center collaborates with Iowa State University, the National Animal Disease Center, and private industry in these efforts.    A second dairy herd has been added at facilities adjacent to the Dairy Center. The new herd is rotationally grazed in warm months and housed in a composting bedded pack building in the winter months. Facilities are designed to demonstrate a low capital investment in milking and housing, a model for new dairy producers, and existing producers wanting to transition their operations. This grazing center complements the existing dairy production facility, providing the capacity to educate and demonstrate both styles of milk production and herd management. Overall student enrollment in the two year program has increased from  students to  students, and  degrees have been awarded in Dairy Technology, Dairy Science Technology, and Dairy Herd Management since the Dairy Center was created. Of the  dairy science sophomore class,  percent are returning to their family farms,  percent will be herd managers or work in the industry, and  percent are continuing their education. Iowa's Dairy Story will surpass , reached this Spring, with rd, th, and th grade students from  different districts enrolled. Upgraded and expanded display areas were added in . The curriculum connects students to the industry with lessons in history, science, human nutrition and health, and animal care.    The total amount of non-federal funds provided for this project for the fiscal year beginning July , , was ; for fiscal year  the amount was ; for fiscal year , ; for fiscal year , ; and for fiscal year , . In fiscal year ,  was provided, including  from Northeast Iowa Community College, mostly for personnel dedicated to the Dairy Center, and  from memberships.    Diabetes detection and prevention.--The Committee provides  for diabetes detection and prevention in Pennsylvania and Washington. The original goal of this integrated extension outreach project was to develop and test a model to provide diabetes screening, prevention education, and case management services for selected rural and urban patient populations in Washington and Hawaii. This goal has been expanded over the course of the grant to provide:    --screening for diabetes among selected rural and urban minority populations in Washington, Hawaii, New Mexico, West Virginia and Pennsylvania, using an innovative, non-invasive ocular fluorescence detection technology developed by scientists at The Joslin Diabetes Center, and blood glucose measures;    --culturally-sensitive and science-based diabetes education prevention and care materials to the targeted audience; and    --case management support and follow-up services for patient referrals.    In brief, the project has attempted to develop a diabetes program that can be delivered to under-served audiences who are outside the standard medical care system and by health professionals and educators without a medical diabetes background.    Since it began, the project has had many accomplishments. Following are several:"

369,109-463 H (Part 1).txt,    For the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service,"    For the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Salaries and Expenses, the Committee recommends an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount appropriated in fiscal year , and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The recommendation does not include  in Animal Welfare Act user fees, as proposed in the President's budget. The Committee does not recommend establishing such fees in annual appropriations acts, but will consider such fees should they achieve authorization.    The following table reflects the amounts provided by the Committee:    To maintain agency functions the Committee provides the requested amount for cost of living requirements.    Funding for indemnities is provided for the brucellosis, tuberculosis, chronic wasting disease, and scrapie programs. The funding is made available until expended, so that unused indemnity funds can be carried over to benefit the program.    High Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI).--The Committee recommendation includes  for the HPAI program. In addition, the funding provided in the fiscal year  supplemental funding for avian influenza,  is available until September , . Of the supplemental funding, the agency is expected to carry over approximately  into fiscal year .    The Committee appreciates the agency's quick response in designing and implementing an HPAI program to protect against the HN strain of the avian influenza virus internationally and domestically. The recommended funding includes:  for domestic surveillance and diagnosis, including anti-smuggling activities;  for wildlife surveillance;  for preparedness and communication, which includes funds for the veterinary vaccine stockpile; and  for international capacity building, primarily for in-country experts in those places most affected by the disease. APHIS is collaborating with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to identify critical needs in other countries' abilities to find HPAI and prevent its spread.    Agricultural Quarantine Inspection.--The Committee includes an appropriation of  for this program, including  for the National Germplasm and Biotechnology Laboratory, as requested.    Fruit Fly Exclusion and Detection.--The Committee recommendation includes an increase of  for fruit fly exclusion and detection, within which is an increase of  for Medfly. Within the total is  for Mexican fruitfly control in Texas, as requested.    Import-Export.--The recommendation provides  for the program, of which  is for continued funding to enhance inspection and surveillance activities for products entering California.    Animal health monitoring and surveillance.--The Committee provides  for animal health monitoring and surveillance, an increase of  over the fiscal year  amount.    Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) surveillance.--The Department has been conducting an enhanced BSE surveillance program since fiscal year . To fund the enhanced program, a total of . million has been transferred from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC): . million in fiscal year , . million in fiscal year  and . million in fiscal year . In addition, appropriated funds over that time period have totaled approximately  million. As of April , , APHIS has completed , tests as part of the enhanced program, and is still conducting about , per week. The design for the regular or ``maintenance'' surveillance program is not complete. The fiscal year  budget request for APHIS includes  for BSE surveillance, which supports , tests per year. The Committee recommendation includes full funding of the request. However, the Committee continues to closely monitor the adoption of the maintenance surveillance program. The Secretary announced on April , , the release of the report ``Summary of Enhanced BSE Surveillance in the United States,'' and stated that the report would be undergoing peer review in May . He further noted that the conclusions of that peer review would help to determine the design of the maintenance BSE surveillance, and that any surveillance plan adopted would meet or exceed international standards. The Committee requests a complete briefing on the final plan before its adoption.    Swine surveillance.--The Committee is concerned about the representation of the swine industry in APHIS' surveillance plans. Last year, funding was provided for the National Animal Health Monitoring System to conduct the fourth national swine study. The Committee encourages APHIS to continue to include swine in its surveillance plans, to expand current market swine surveillance so that a sufficient percentage of market hogs are included.    Animal Identification.--Through fiscal year , a total of  has been provided for a National Animal Identification System. Of that amount, approximately  has been used for cooperative agreements with states and Tribes to assist in registration. The fiscal year  request is for . Until August , the Department had stated that program data would be held centrally; however, the Secretary announced in August that data would be held by private entities that meet certain requirements. In addition, the program is voluntary, but there have been mixed signals about participation becoming mandatory in the future. At least one state has made data collection compulsory, and states have the discretion to charge fees for registration. Given these management challenges, and the fact that just  percent of the premises have been registered, the Committee has concerns about the program. Premises identification is a necessary building block, but in itself does not offer any means of animal traceback. The Committee feels that all interested parties would benefit from a transparent process of decision making on the national plans for animal identification and therefore requires that the Secretary use an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to state the Administration's plans for animal identification, and to solicit feedback from all interested parties.    The Committee directs that not less than  be provided for a cooperative agreement with the Wisconsin Livestock Identification Consortium. This project supports the national plan to establish an animal and livestock -hour traceback system.    The Committee provides not less than  for the Farm Animal Identification and Records (FAIR) program. Both the Wisconsin consortium and the FAIR project should also be eligible to apply for cooperative agreement funding for animal identification, which is funded within the NAIS total.    The Committee provides  to implement a database of North Carolina's agriculture industry for rapid response capabilities.    The Committee provides funding for the New Mexico Syndromic Validation Program at  to support early detection of pathogens in animals and prevent their spread.    The Committee provides  for Iowa State University's work regarding risk assessments of genetically modified agricultural products.    Emergency management systems.--The Committee provides  for Field emergency coordinators and  for the vaccine bank.    Pest detection.--The Committee provides an increase of  for Pest Detection, including an increase of  for surveys through the state-based Cooperative Agricultural Pest Surveys system and an increase of  for surveillance.    The Committee provides  in funding to continue a cooperative agreement with the California County Pest Detection Augmentation Program.    Select Agents.--The total provided is an increase of  over the fiscal year  amount, as requested.    The Committee is concerned about the management issues raised in audits conducted by the Office of the Inspector General; in particular, about controls and security of select agents. The Committee provides the full amount requested for the Select Agents program, and experts resolution of all issues raised by the OIG.    Biological Control.--The Committee recommendation includes  for biological control, the same as the budget request. Within that amount, funding is included to support the Vine Mealy Bug control operations at no less than the current level of .    Brucellosis.--The Committee continues to provide the fiscal year  funding level for the Greater Yellowstone Interagency Brucellosis Committee to eliminate brucellosis from wildlife in the Greater Yellowstone area.    Chronic wasting disease.--For chronic wasting disease, the Committee provides . The Committee directs that of this amount  shall go to the State of Wisconsin.    Cotton Pests.--The Committee recommendation includes the consolidation of the Boll Weevil and Pink Bollworm line items into a new Cotton Pests program, as requested. The total provided is  to address boll weevil, pink bollworm, and other cotton pests or diseases. This amount is  above the budget request.    Emerging plant pests.--The Committee expects the Secretary of Agriculture to continue to use the authority provided in this bill to transfer funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) for the arrest and eradication of animal and plant pests and diseases that threaten American agriculture. By providing funds in this account, the Committee is enhancing, but not replacing, the use of CCC funding for emergency outbreaks.    For emerging plant pests, the Committee includes  an increase of  over the fiscal year  level. The Committee provides the following amounts for eradication and control activities:  for citrus pests and diseases,  for Glassy-winged Sharpshooter/Pierce's Disease,  for Emerald Ash Borer,  for Sudden Oak Death,  for Asian Long-horned Beetle, and  for Karnal bunt.    The Committee provides  in this account for control and eradication of the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB), which is a  increase over the fiscal year  level. In addition, in April , the Administration made  available from the Commodity Credit Corporation for the EAB program. The Administration should continue the support of the EAB program through appropriate and necessary use of the CCC. The Committee expects the EAB program to focus on eradication of outbreaks found in Ohio, Indiana, and the Upper Peninsula so that EAB does not spread, and to take action to prevent any means of spread.    For control of the Asian Long-horned Beetle (ALB), the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  over last year's amount. ALB threatens all hardwood trees, and is of great concern in the Northeast, particularly in New York and New Jersey.    The Committee provides  to the Citrus Health Response Program (CHRP) to address the immediate threat of exotic citrus pests and diseases, perform regulatory oversight of fruit certification for shipment both domestically and internationally, protect the integrity of the citrus nursery and budwood certification programs, and prevent the spread of citrus pests and diseases.    The Committee encourages APHIS to monitor plan importations for Sudden Oak Death (SOD), harmonize federal and state SOD regulations, and to conduct outreach and education activities with outdoor recreational users and commercial entities (such as, construction companies) that could contribute to soil movement as well as with affected SOD industries, including nurseries.    The Committee provides  for hydrilla eradication around Lake Gaston in Virginia and North Carolina, and expects APHIS to monitor the effectiveness of hydrilla eradication around Smith Mountain Lake in Virginia.    Imported fire ant.--The Committee provides  for imported fire ant of which  is for New Mexico.    Johne's Disease.--The Committee provides  for Johne's disease, which is  above the budget request.    Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza.--The Committee provides  the same as the request, for activities relating to the prevention, control, and eradication of Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI). Within the total amount,  is to support surveillance through the National Poultry Improvement Plan and  to support surveillance in live bird markets. In addition,  for indemnities, which was provided in fiscal year , remains available to the program.    The Committee notes for the third consecutive year that APHIS has combated Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza through both depopulation and vaccination, depending on individual circumstances. An emergency vaccination protocol was agreed to by APHIS and used most successfully after an outbreak on a farm in Connecticut for which there has been no indemnification. The Committee notes that the Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to utilize funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation or other authority to compensate producers for vaccination costs and related flock losses previously incurred due to the outbreak in Connecticut, and the resulting sequential depopulation and restricted use of a USDA approved and authorized avian influenza vaccine. The Committee expects APHIS to act on its authority and utilize available funds, including funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation, to indemnify Connecticut producers this year who have previously filed a claim for costs and losses related to this avian influenza outbreak.    Wildlife services.--The Committee continues the fiscal year  funding level for aviation safety and provides increases for wildlife surveillance and wildlife services state operations, as requested. The recommendation assumes the continuation of current cost share levels for cooperators. The Committee directs that, other than funding for the specific items noted in this report, the funds provided in the Wildlife Services line item are available for general operations needs.    The Committee continues to provide  for wolf predation management, of which  is for Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan, and  is for New Mexico and Arizona.    The Committee continues funding for the following projects:  for Beaver management in North Carolina;  for crop and aquaculture losses in southeast Missouri;  for predation wildlife services in western and southside Virginia;  for blackbird control in Louisiana;  for predator control programs in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming;  for wildlife services in Texas;  for beaver management and damage in Wisconsin;  for brown tree snake management in Guam;  for Hawaii and Guam operations;  for cormorant control in New York;  for cormorant control in Michigan and Ohio; and maintains the fiscal year  funding level for surveillance in North Dakota.    The Committee provides a  increase above the fiscal year  level for a cooperative rabies oral rabies vaccination program, for a total of . The Committee expects APHIS to use program funding to appropriately address rabies in Broward County, Florida.    Within the Aviation Safety activities, the Committee encourages APHIS to expand research work into what can be done to deter birds from the increasing number of wind turbine generators around the nation.    Veterinary Diagnostics.--Within the total provided for Veterinary Diagnostics, the fiscal year  amount is continued for an Agricultural Biosecurity Center at Kansas State University. The funding level supports not less than  for the National Animal Health Laboratory Network.    Wildlife services methods development.--The Committee recommendation includes  for the requested Avian influenza initiative to study the virus in swine. The Committee provides  in funding for the National Wildlife Research Station in Kingsville, Texas, to address emerging infectious disease issues associated with wildlife populations.    The Committee provides funding to continue the cooperative agreement between the Hawaii Agricultural Research Center and the National Wildlife Research Center in Hilo at the fiscal year  level.    Animal welfare.--The Committee recommendation includes an increase of  to further improve Animal Welfare Act enforcement, for a total of  as requested. This responds to Animal Care's significantly increased workload as a result of rapid growth in the number of new licensees and registrants."

The recommendation includes funding for each of the  Resource Conservation and Development (RC&D) Councils to have a Federal coordinator. The budget request proposes cutting the number of coordinators by half, and having coordinators serve several councils. The Committee notes that no pilot test or cost analysis was conducted to determine the feasibility of such an action, or the potential effect on Council performance. This is a concern, considering that the coordinator plays an important role in leveraging Federal funding to meet local needs. According to data provided by NRCS for the Record, Federal funding to Councils is matched by non-Federal funding at an eight-to-one ratio; in fiscal year , Federal funding to councils totaled ; non-Federal assistance totaled .    The Committee requests that NRCS continue to work with the Councils to develop appropriate measures of effectiveness for both conservation and economic development. Therefore future budget proposals can be based on the effectiveness and performance of the program.    The Committee expects the NRCS to promptly fill RC&D coordinator vacancies, and to allocate funding equitably among the existing councils.    The Committee has included bill language related to a cooperative agreement with a national association.    The Committee has included bill language limiting the amount that can be spent at national headquarters from this account."

The Committee recommendation for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is . The Committee notes that since the budget request was submitted last February, several estimates provided in the Presidents budget for the WIC program have changed. The Committee also does not include several proposals requested in the President's budget, changing the estimated program needs in the WIC program. Estimates for participation and food costs have declined for fiscal year  and fiscal year , increasing the expected carry-over funds from fiscal year  to  and decreasing the estimate for program needs in fiscal year . Also, there is currently estimated the WIC program will have an unobligated balance in the contingency reserve of about  which is  above the original appropriation of  provided for the reserve. The Committee included a provision to allow the unobligated balance over  to be used for program needs.    The Committee does not include the provision as requested in the President's budget, that requires funding for nutrition services and administration (NSA) grants to State be capped at  percent of the total amount provided, increasing the estimate for NSA funding.    The Committee provided an appropriation for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) in the Commodity Assistance Program. The President's budget did not request funding for the CSFP program and estimated a higher participation rate in the WIC and FSP for the CSFP participants in fiscal year .    Therefore, the recommended funding level,  above the budget request, is currently estimated to be sufficient to meet program needs. However, the Committee will continue to monitor WIC food costs, participation, and carry-over funds, and take additional action as necessary to ensure that funding provided in fiscal year  is sufficient to serve all eligible applicants.    The recommended funding level includes  for continuation of the breastfeeding peer counselor program.    The Committee provides  for investments in management information systems, if the Secretary determines that those funds are not needed to maintain caseload and will not require use of the contingency fund.    The Committee does not include language requested by the Administration, that provides guidance that funds under this heading shall not be used for WIC benefits for individuals who receive medical assistance or whose family member is a pregnant woman or infant who receives assistance, unless their family falls below  percent of the applicable poverty guidelines.

WIC Services and Referrals.--While the Committee supports State and local agency efforts to utilize WIC as a means of participation referral to other health care services, it also recognizes the constraints that WIC programs experience as a result of expanding health care priorities and continuing demand for core WIC program activities. The Committee wishes to clarify that while WIC plays an important role in screening and referral to other health care services, it is not the Committee's intention that WIC should perform aggressive screening, referral and assessment functions in a manner that supplants the responsibilities of other programs, nor should WIC State and local agencies assume the burden of entering into and negotiating appropriate cost sharing agreements. The committee again includes language in the bill to preserve WIC funding for WIC services authorized by law to ensure that WIC funds are not used to pay the expenses or to coordinate operations or activities other than those allowable pursuant to section  of the Child Nutrition Act of , unless fully reimbursed by the appropriate Federal agency.    Food Prescription Package.--The Committee notes the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of  requires the Department to issue a final rule, within  months of receiving the Institute of Medicine's report, to modify the WIC food packages. The Committee directs the Department to move expeditiously in consultation with WIC agencies to develop for public comment a food prescription rule responding to the needs of the WIC population and to provide quarterly reports to the Committee regarding the status and publication of a final rule beginning July , ."

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) (P.L. -) provided  to the Office of the Secretary for assistance to agricultural producers impacted by the coronavirus health emergency.    Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Farmers.--The Committee is interested in the actions the USDA has taken to recruit and outreach to Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander farmers.

The Committee is very concerned about these issues as well, particularly the potential fragmentation among these programs, and looks forward to GAO's findings in its upcoming report. The Committee directs the Secretary of Agriculture and the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, working with the other members of the Interagency Committee on Human Nutrition Research (ICHNR), to convene a meeting within  days of the release of the GAO report to address any shortcomings identified by GAO in how the various federal agencies and departments currently collaborate and utilize federal resources to reduce and eliminate diet-related chronic disease. Lastly, the Committee directs the USDA and FDA to provide a joint briefing to the Committees on the corresponding strategic plan within  days of the release of the GAO report.    Disclosures Under the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act.--The Committee recognizes the national security risk posed by foreign investment in domestic agricultural land. For this reason, the Committee urges USDA to prioritize the tracking and reporting of foreign investment in agricultural land and verifying the accuracy of filings made by foreign investors who acquire, transfer or hold an interest in U.S. agricultural land.    Emissions Reduction Plan.--The Committee recognizes the urgent necessity of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to mitigate the impacts of global climate change and the important role the agriculture sector can play in that effort. The Committee encourages USDA to consider climate impacts and emissions reductions centrally in its activities and directs USDA to provide not later than  days after the enactment of this Act a report outlining its plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.    ERS/NIFA Move.--It has been almost exactly two years since the Secretary announced the decision to relocate ERS and NIFA outside of the greater Washington, D.C. area. Despite objections from the Committee, members of the House and Senate, numerous current and former staff of both agencies, and stakeholders who depend on the information and support provided by each agency, the Department relocated both agencies, starting in the summer of . The Committee reiterates its frustration at the repeated difficulties it experiences in getting basic information about the move from the Department. One of the stated reasons for the move was to improve the Department's ability to attract and retain highly qualified staff. At the time of the relocation announcement, both ERS and NIFA each had close to  employees. Today, the total number of employees for each agency is below . ERS and NIFA are shells of their former selves and the loss of institutional knowledge each agency has suffered will take years to overcome. The Committee requests the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to conduct symposia to elucidate the effects of the relocation of each agency. The symposium on ERS shall include an examination of the policy-oriented work conducted by ERS both before and after the relocation and identify any gaps in output that might adversely affect the quality and quantity of data and analysis available to the agency's stakeholders. The symposium on NIFA shall include a discussion of the grants management, time to completion of grants processing and issuance of letters of funding, and panel review processes and associated costs of the agency both before and after the relocation and documentation of delays that have occurred post-relocation. The Committee expects the symposia to clarify the consequences of relocation on the capacity of the agencies to deliver their programs and to explore remedial actions that could be taken to address any deficiencies that arise from the relocation and from attendant disruptions to agency functions and personnel.    Explanatory Notes.--The Committee appreciates receiving the detailed information provided in the Explanatory Notes prepared by the Department and relies heavily on this information when considering budget proposals. Without consultation with or approval from the Committee, the Department changed the format of these materials for the fiscal year  budget request. For fiscal year  and future years, the Department is directed to present Explanatory Notes in a format consistent with the presentation used for the fiscal year  Budget, with similar display and narrative and table contents. The Explanatory Notes should also put the accounts in the same order as the accounts in the bill. Any deviations from that format are to be approved in advance by the Committee.    The justifications for the fiscal year  budget request are also insufficient. Much of the justification materials is a restatement of the proposed changes and not an explanation or rationale to justify the changes. The Committee cannot support proposals in the budget submission that include significant changes with no justification and basis. The Committee strongly encourages the Department to improve the quality of its budget justifications.    Goodfellow Federal Center.--The Committee provides a total of  to start relocating USDA employees from the Goodfellow Federal Center in St. Louis, MO. Due to the potential environmental hazards at the complex identified in the April  GSA Inspector General report, USDA has made provisions to move its employees from the facility. The Committee understands that USDA is working with GSA to obtain relief for buildout and relocation expenses, including furniture and equipment costs, for USDA occupants compelled to leave the facility for the continued health, safety, and welfare of its employees. The Committee directs USDA to continue working with GSA to help offset future relocation costs and to report regularly on this effort. The Committee awaits this information and further progress on the search for appropriate facilities before appropriating additional funds.    Grain Terminals.--The Committee notes the ongoing contract negotiations between West Coast grain terminal operators and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and recognizes the importance of reaching an agreement that works for both parties. A failure to reach an agreement could result in an interruption in grain terminal service that would negatively impact the nation's grain exports. The Committee urges all parties to continue negotiating in good faith to ensure an equitable outcome for both grain terminal operators and their workers is expeditiously reached.    Hemp.--The Committee is aware of the difficulty farmers face in trying to control the legal tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content of their hemp. The Committee recognizes that these challenges are exacerbated by lack of information, best practices, and tools to control the hemp content of THC. The Committee directs USDA to report to Congress on the number of acres of hemp, by state that have been required to be destroyed because the crop exceeds the limit . percent THC content; the number of producers, by state, who are found to have a negligent violation of the . percent limit; and the total number, by state, of producers whose hemp has been tested for THC.    Loan and Grant Programs.--The Committee directs that if an estimate of loan activity for any program funded in Titles II and III of this bill indicates that a limitation on authority to make commitments for a fiscal year will be reached before the end of that fiscal year, or in any event when  percent of the authority to make commitments has been utilized, the Secretary shall promptly notify the Committees through OBPA. The Committee directs the Department, through OBPA, to provide quarterly reports to the Committees on the status of obligations and funds availability for the loan and grant programs provided in this bill.

The Committee directs the Secretary to review the memorandum and prioritize appropriate assistance to the lobster industry.    National Finance Center.--The National Finance Center (NFC) is the largest designated Federal Government Payroll Shared Service Provider and it provides integrated payroll and personnel services for over , Federal employees. To ensure that thousands of Federal employees' pay and human resources services are not interrupted or adversely impacted by major organizational changes, the Committee has modified requirements under current law relating to NFC payroll and shared services operations, missions, personnel, and functions. The Committee also directs the USDA to provide quarterly reports on full-time equivalent (FTE) levels for each of the current NFC divisions, operations, and functions, as well as each of the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) and Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) divisions, operations, and functions currently co-located with the NFC. The reports also are to include a detailed breakdown of the FTEs for each and any of these same divisions, functions, or operations for the NFC and the co-located OCFO and OCIO functions compared to those during FY  and .    Native Plant Use Preference.--The Committee continues to support the use of locally adapted native plant materials in the undertaking of land management activity on Federal lands under the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture, including in maintenance and in restoration in response to degradation caused by human activity or natural events (such as fire, flood, or infestation). The Committee directs that it be the policy of the USDA that preference shall be made, to the extent practicable, for the use of locally adapted native plant materials in these cases.    New Initiatives.--The Committee is concerned about the Department's tardiness in implementing new initiatives funded in the annual appropriations Acts. No later than  days after enactment, the Department is requested to submit an execution strategy for each new initiative funded in this Act. This strategy should include, but is not limited to, the steps necessary to make funding available, the timeline thereof, targeted beneficiaries, and expected results. The Committee requests quarterly reports on these initiatives until the initiative has been fully implemented.    Notification Requirements.--The Committee reminds the Department that the Committee uses the definitions for transfer, reprogramming, and program, project, and activity as defined by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). As noted in the  Joint Explanatory Statement, a program, project, or activity (PPA) is an element within a budget account. PPAs are identified by reference to include the most specific level of budget items identified in the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Act, , accompanying Committee reports, explanatory statements, and budget justifications. The Committee notes that the most specific level of budget items in the USDA budget justifications is not limited to tables titled ``Project Statement''.    One Health Initiative.--USDA has partnered with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency to leverage its resources to address health risks to human and animals.

The Committee is concerned about the short comment period provided for such a potentially significant shift in policy. Prior to finalizing any change to performance management policy, the Committee directs the Department to survey employees and to reopen the comment period to seek additional comments from the public. The Department is further directed to brief the Committee within  days after the end of the comment period. The briefing shall include, but not be limited to, results of the employee survey; all comments received; plans to address concerns; and data and analysis supporting any changes from the current system.    Protecting Animals with Shelter Grants Program.--The Committee provides  for the program. It directs the Secretary of Agriculture to continue coordinating with other federal agencies to efficiently implement the grant program for providing emergency and transitional shelter options for domestic violence survivors with companion animals.    Review of Nutrition Programs.--The Committee encourages the Secretary to review Department-wide nutrition programs, with the full participation of Indian tribes and tribal organizations, to consider ways in which more Native foods can be incorporated into these programs where possible and the possibility of allowing tribes to provide input into federal nutritional guidance that reflects unique Indian tribal need.    Rural Broadband.--The Committee continues to support the Re-Connect program to increase access to broadband connectivity in unserved rural communities. The Committee continues to direct the Department to target grants and loans to areas of the country with the largest broadband coverage gaps. These projects should utilize technology that will maximize coverage of broadband with the most benefit to taxpayers and the rural communities served. Technologies to consider should include, but are not limited to, fiber, cable modem, fixed wireless, and television white space. The bill includes funding for broadband deployment through the Broadband Loan program, Community Connect grant program, Distance Learning and Telemedicine program and  for the ReConnect program.    Small Producers.--The Committee recognizes that local farms are eager to sell to the emergency food system and contribute to the food security of their communities. However, small producers face significant barriers acquiring federal third-party food safety audits such as Good Agricultural Practices and Good Handling Practices. The Committee directs the Secretary to make assistance available to small producers to assist them in taking the steps necessary to participate in federal food programs.    Spending Plans.--The bill continues a provision in Title VII that requires USDA to submit spending plans to the Committee within  days of enactment. Previous versions of these plans have not included adequate details that would be useful for Committee oversight. Beginning with the fiscal year  plans, the Committee requests that the USDA spending plans include for each program, project, or activity: () a comparison between the congressional budget justification funding levels, the most recent congressional directives or approved funding levels, and the funding levels proposed by the department or agency; and () a clear, concise, and informative description/justification. The Committee reminds USDA of notification requirements, also included in Title VII, for all applicable changes.    Status of House and Senate Report Language.--The Department is directed to include in its fiscal year  Congressional Justification, as a single exhibit, a table listing all deliverables, with a column for due dates if applicable. The Office of Budget and Program Analysis (OBPA) is directed to provide updates on the status of House and Senate reports upon request from the Committees.    USDA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Data Sharing Efforts.--The Committee recognizes that the EPA Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES) emission modeling system is used to estimate emissions for mobile sources for air pollutants, greenhouse gases, and air toxics. The Committee encourages USDA to work with EPA on sharing and gathering blended fuels data necessary for future updates to the MOVES model.    USDA-owned Vehicles.--The Committee awaits the report requested in the fiscal year  report on how the Department plans to better manage its vehicle fleet.    USDA presence in Puerto Rico.--The Committee recognizes the work undertaken by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) to compile data that informs farmers and producers in U.S. jurisdictions. The Committee further recognizes the importance of their presence in Puerto Rico to have a complete understanding of the role of agriculture in Puerto Rico's economy and food availability. The Committee notes that the fiscal year  House report directed NASS to explore reestablishing a physical presence in Puerto Rico and report back to the Committees; the Committee looks forward to receiving this report. The Committee directs the Department to submit a report on the efforts and personnel of NASS and AMS in Puerto Rico not later than  days after the enactment of this Act.    Vacancy Rates.--The Committee remains concerned with the rising number of technical staff and research vacancies at all agencies within the Research, Education, and Economics Mission Area and strongly encourages USDA to fill these vacancies expeditiously.    Victory Gardens.--The Committee recognizes the pressure the COVID- pandemic is putting on our food supply chain and on vulnerable families. During World War I and World War II, Americans grew ``Victory Gardens'' as a patriotic means of ensuring food security. The Committee encourages the Secretary to use the model of the ``The People's Garden'' and use available funds to promote a new ``Victory Garden'' campaign across the country to citizens and schools in food insecure regions. Funding should be used for seeds and gardening education materials."

Broadband Mapping.--The Committee recognizes the Department's active engagement on accurate mapping, but still has concerns about maps produced by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to determine eligibility for broadband programs. These maps may be outdated and do not use the most accurate and granular data available. This puts rural communities at a disadvantage, as applicants are unable to qualify for grants and loans when these maps show their community, farm, or business has access to a level of service that they in fact do not. Until Congress and the FCC are able to produce higher quality maps, the Committee encourages USDA to explore alternative map options which use more accurate information to determine eligibility. The Committee also encourages the Department to conduct a study of how it can improve its eligibility standards to accurately reflect the availability of broadband service in the applicant's proposed service area in order to fairly and effectively determine eligibility for any loans, grants, or other USDA programs.

This will assist by encouraging and strengthening efforts to provide food to underserved regions.    Local Food.--The Committee recognizes the growing demand for locally and regionally produced food. The Committee encourages all nutrition programs, to the extent possible, to engage local agriculture producers to enhance small farmers and regional producers.    National Waivers.--The Committee urges the Secretary of Agriculture to issue a nationwide waiver as soon as possible that extends the current Area Eligibility and Non-Congregate Feeding waivers and allows school districts to use Summer Foodservice Program and the Seamless Summer Option regulations for the duration of the - school year.    Public Release of Information.--The Committee directs FNS to continue making all policy documents related to the WIC program (including, but not limited to, instructions, memoranda, guidance, and questions and answers) available to the public on the Internet within one week of their release to WIC state administrators.

It directs FNS to include all territories, including those that receive block grants, in any studies it does on the Child Nutrition Programs.    Cost of School Meals in Alaska and Hawaii.--The Committee directs the USDA to update its  calculation of the national average payment adjustments in Alaska and Hawaii, which was required in P.L. -, to reflect the  cost of producing a school lunch and a school breakfast.    Lead in Water.--The Committee recognizes that communities across the nation struggle with water access, affordability, and quality, which can exacerbate nutritional deficiencies. The Committee recognizes good nutrition can help prevent or minimize the absorption of lead in the body and encourages USDA to improve access to nutritional resources in communities facing lead contamination in their water.    Length of School Meals.--The Committee is aware that providing adequate time to eat healthy school meals increases the consumption of fruits and vegetables and minimizes food waste. The Committee encourages the Department to work with the Department of Education to help develop materials encouraging adequate mealtimes.

The Committee directs the FNS Administrator to report on its progress to the Senate and House Appropriations Committees within  days of enactment of this Act.    Nutrition Innovation and Support.--The Committee recognizes that consistent access to fresh and nutritious food is vital to children's health and development. The Committee encourages the Secretary to provide technical assistance to States pursuing efficient, flexible, innovative, and data informed delivery models within the Summer Food Service Program. The Committee also encourages the Secretary to provide technical assistance to schools in preparing fresh fruits and vegetables.    Pulse Crop Products Program.--Adding more pulse crops in the school meal programs may provide a high quality, affordable, and versatile source of nutrition for our children. The Committee encourages FNS to build greater awareness in the number and variety of pulse crop products and pulse ingredients available and served to children in school.    School Breakfast Expansion Grants.--The Committee remains concerned that while participation in the School Breakfast Program is increasing, many children who are eligible for the School Breakfast Program are not participating. Therefore, the Committee provides  for grants for expansion of the School Breakfast Program, of which  is dedicated to the U.S. territories.    School Nutrition Standards.--Within  days of enactment, the Committee directs the Department to publish on its website data on the compliance of school food authorities with respect to the nutritional requirements under section (f) of the Richard B.

USDA is estimating recovery and carryover funds to be higher than average. Furthermore, the Secretary has a WIC contingency reserve fund as a safety net to meet unexpected demand. With lower participation rates, higher carryover funds, and an ample reserve fund, the Committee provides funding that will ensure all eligible participants will be served. Further, the Committee notes that any unspent funds from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act would be available for use in meeting fiscal year  needs.    The Committee recognizes that, due to COVID-, funding needs might change before the final  bill is enacted. The Committee is steadfast in its commitment to fully fund WIC and will continue to monitor WIC participation, the status of funds appropriated in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, carryover funds, and food costs, and it will take additional action as necessary to ensure that funding provided in fiscal year  remains sufficient to serve all eligible applicants.    Breastfeeding Rates.--The Committee is interested in understanding how to improve breastfeeding rates, especially as higher rates have been linked to lower childhood obesity. The Committee also recognizes that there are many barriers to breastfeeding as detailed in CDC's  Breastfeeding Report Card.

The Committee strongly condemns USDA's continued efforts to restrict access and limit eligibility for SNAP. The Committee recognizes SNAP is one of the most effective forms of economic stimulus and is dedicated to removing barriers to participation. Thus, the Committee includes bill language to block the Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents rule (ABAWD) and the Standard Utility Allowance rule (SUA), and strongly encourages the Secretary to withdraw the Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility rule (BBCE). These three rules would take away SNAP benefits from nearly  million people and the Committee believes this will worsen the unprecedented economic uncertainty among our nation's most vulnerable populations.    College Hunger.--The Committee remains concerned that SNAP-eligible students who are food-insecure lack proper information about resources available to them. The Committee continues to direct FNS to make information available on its website regarding student SNAP eligibility requirements easier to understand and more accessible.

The Committee recognizes that protocols are in place to assist in determining which modality response is most appropriate for each situation. This modality decision tool incorporates factors such as market suitability, context-specific restraints to success and identified objectives, and cost efficiency. Given the level and scale of complex international humanitarian disasters, and the fact that population needs and contexts differ widely among crises, the Committee encourages the Department to utilize whatever modality responses are most appropriate, including use of local or regional procurement, cash transfers, vouchers, and in-kind contributions from the United States."

Farmer-to-Farmer.--The Committee notes that last year's House report directed USDA to provide a briefing to the Committee on how USDA can maximize its participation in the John Ogonowski and Doug Bereuter Farmer-to-Farmer program (Farmer-to-Farmer). As part of the brief, the Committee directs USDA to include a list of recommendations for how to enhance its participation in Farmer-to-Farmer, including a discussion of how Farmer-to-Farmer can work collaboratively with other USDA-funded programs such as -H, the Cooperative Extension System, the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program, and other government agencies such as U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In addition, the Committee directs USAID to coordinate with USDA on incorporating the role of the agricultural officer to maximize the efficacy of the Farmer-to-Farmer program.    International Agricultural Education Fellowship.--The Committee provides  for this program as authorized in the  Farm Bill. The Committee notes that last year's House Report directed USDA to brief the Committees on how the International Agricultural Education Fellowship program will work in collaboration with other ongoing Foreign Agricultural service program to achieve USDA's goals. The Committee expects this brief to also include a discussion of how this program will work in collaboration with other USDA-funded programs such as -H, the Cooperative Extension System, the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program, and other government agencies such as U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.    Technical Assistance.--The Committee recognizes the challenge of global hunger and the need to improve the delivery of assistance to meet food security requirements and to improve nutritional standards for underserved populations. The Committee encourages the Department to provide technical assistance to international entities and organizations that develop and improve food and nutrition safety net systems. The Committee directs the Department to provide to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress, not later than  days, after the enactment of this Act a briefing on its ongoing and previous technical assistance efforts described above.    U.S.-Central America, Mexico Cooperation.--The Committee directs FAS to work with its counterparts in Central America and Mexico to develop agricultural working groups focused on improving the efficiency of the agricultural inspection process and agricultural trade facilitation issues.

The Committee recommendation includes the following offices under the Office of the Secretary: Immediate Office of the Secretary; Office of Tribal Relations; Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Coordination; Office of Advocacy and Outreach; Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration; Departmental Administration; Office of the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations; and Office of Communications.    Pay Cost.--The Committee does not include requested funding for a civilian pay increase across the Department. Should the President provide a civilian pay increase for , it is assumed that the cost of such a pay increase will be absorbed within existing appropriations for fiscal year .    Improper Payments.--In May , USDA's OIG released a report entitled ``USDA's Fiscal Year  Compliance with Improper Payment Requirements''. The OIG noted that last year marked the fourth straight year the agency failed to comply with mandatory reporting requirements regarding improper payment information. For fiscal year , USDA reported that these programs accounted for an estimated . billion in improper payments, or a . percent improper payment rate. This represents an increase in the improper payment rate and an increase of  million above the improper payments in fiscal year . While there has been recent progress in some areas toward improving the Department's processes to identify, report, and reduce wasteful spending, this level of improper payment is clearly unacceptable. As the report notes, it is critical for the Office of the Chief Financial Officer and senior officials for each noncompliant agency to set aggressive goals to help USDA achieve compliance with the Improper Payments Information Act of .    In the fiscal year  Explanatory Statement accompanying the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of , the Committee required a report for the Department's Chief Financial Officer to develop a plan to significantly reduce USDA's improper payment rate in fiscal year  and to release it simultaneously with the OIG's report on improper payments for fiscal year . USDA failed to comply with this directive and is still accountable for the plan.    Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Report.--The Committee directs the Secretary to provide a report on November , , and May , , on planned uses of funding under the authorities of Section  and Section  of the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act.    Avian Influenza.--The Committee appreciates the Department's response to the recent outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) which is causing considerable devastation to America's commercial poultry industry. The Department has diligently worked with Federal and State agencies, stakeholders and growers to implement the best surveillance and biosecurity efforts to stop and slow the spread of the disease. The Committee recognizes the Department's efforts to assist growers in repopulating their flocks and strengthening biosecurity measures. The Department should utilize all resources necessary to expand technical assistance and outreach to the poultry community in order to prevent the spread of this virus. The Committee encourages the Department to continue their work with trading partners to minimize trade impacts on poultry and poultry products to the greatest extent possible. The Committee will continue to closely monitor the situation and directs USDA to keep the Committee apprised of future developments.    Notification.--Within  days from the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall notify the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate on the allocation of the funds provided to the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations by USDA agency, along with an explanation for the agency-by-agency distribution of the funds.    State Office Collocation.--The Committee continues to direct that any reallocation of resources related to the collocation of state offices scheduled for fiscal year  and subsequent years is subject to the Committee's reprogramming procedures required under law.    Administrative Provision.--The Committee directs the Secretary to advise the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate, through the Office of Budget and Program Analysis (OBPA), of the status of all reports requested of the Department in this bill at the time of submission of the fiscal year  budget and monthly thereafter. The Department needs to improve its timeliness in adhering to a similar requirement in the fiscal year  House appropriations report. The Committee reminds the Secretary that all correspondence related to the directives in this bill must be addressed to the Committee on Appropriations.    Loan and Grant Programs.--The Committee directs the Department, through OBPA, to provide quarterly reports to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate on the status of obligations and funds availability for the loan and grant programs provided in this bill.    The Committee further directs that if an estimate of loan activity for any program funded in Titles I and III of this bill indicates that a limitation on authority to make commitments for a fiscal year will be reached before the end of that fiscal year, or in any event whenever  percent of the authority to make commitments has been utilized, the Secretary shall promptly notify the Committees through OBPA.    Communication from USDA.--The Department is reminded that the Members of the Committee must be informed of the activities, pending and proposed actions, and expenditures made by USDA and its respective agencies so that Congress can determine whether laws and programs are being implemented and carried out in accordance with the intent of Congress. A collaborative working relationship between the Committees and agencies is necessary to ensure efficient and effective implementation of Congress's funding decisions. USDA is directed to ensure the Committees are notified of major changes to existing policies and any significant developments in its operations prior to providing non-governmental stakeholders such information.    The Committee is dissatisfied with the Department's response to the allegations of animal mistreatment at the ARS MARC facility in Clay Center, Nebraska. The agency has been delinquent in meeting deadlines and slow to provide necessary information. The Department must improve their communication, and the Committee expects the Department to provide information and requested materials in a timely manner.    Decentralized Rent and Homeland Security.--In fiscal year , the Committee provided the Department with authority to decentralize rent from the General Services Agency (GSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Secretary submitted this request ``as part of USDA's implementation of the President's `Freeze the Federal Footprint' initiative'' to encourage efficiencies across the Department at individual agencies. On the contrary, USDA did not freeze, but expanded its footprint by approximately , square feet. Meanwhile, the Secretary has claimed savings of . million, while there will be a projected increase of . million since fiscal year .    The Secretary is directed to find actual savings within the total estimated costs for fiscal year , in accordance with the President's new ``Reduce the Federal Footprint'' initiative. If USDA does not find ways to reduce its physical footprint or the cost of its existing footprint, such increased costs will need to be absorbed by the agency at the detriment of the core missions of these agencies. Further, the Committee in fiscal year  directed that ``any future requests for increases to rent and security costs will need to be accompanied by detailed justifications.'' USDA has not provided such justification. The following table shows the increased costs, with the most recently available data as provided by USDA:"

Drought Resilience.--The Committee is concerned about the extent and severity of drought in the U.S. and recognizes the importance of understanding and being prepared for drought. The Committee encourages the OCE to continue research and work with partners on drought resilience efforts to better address the serious threat posed by drought in the U.S., including in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico.    Policy Research.--The Committee includes  for policy research under  U.S.C.  for entities with existing institutional capacity, including staff, databases, models, and long-term, well-documented experience, to conduct complex economic and baseline analysis for the benefit of USDA, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Congress.    Under Secretary for Trade and Foreign Affairs.--The Committee continues to support the establishment of a new Under Secretary for Trade and Foreign Affairs required by Public Law -. The Committee urges the OCE to work in coordination with the National Academy of Public Affairs (NAPA) to complete the independent study commissioned by the Committee. The Committee also directs the Secretary to complete the study on this topic required in Section (b)() of Public Law -. The study required by the  farm bill of the Secretary is almost a year overdue. The Committee notes that the study being performed by NAPA does not satisfy that required by the Secretary.    Food Manufacturing Efficiencies.--The Committee is aware of the potential for many new and promising food manufacturing processes and technologies. The nation's food supply can be made safer, more secure, better and more affordable through such means as automation of equipment and modifying processes along the entire supply chain to work more efficiently and use less water, energy and other resources. The Committee urges the Department to promote enhanced technology, processes, and data analysis throughout the food manufacturing industry."

Administrative Reorganization.--The Committee does not concur with the agency's proposal to combine NIFA Research and Education Activities, Extension Activities, and Integrated Activities into one account. While the Committee supports greater efficiency in the management of limited federal research dollars, the proposal fails to demonstrate that such reorganization would result in significant savings or the improvement of programs offered through NIFA.    Coffee Plant Health.--The Committee appreciates ARS and NIFA's work to address existing and emerging challenges to coffee production in the United States and commends the agency's work with research partners and coffee grower groups. The Committee encourages ARS, NIFA, and its partners to maintain support for coffee plant health research.    Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).--This year marks the th Anniversary of the signing of the Second Morrill Act of , which provided land-grant status to selected HBCUs. For over  years, these HBCUs have had a long-standing tradition of institutional commitment to excellence in teaching, scholarship, and service. The legacy of these land-grant universities will be further strengthened based on current and future investments and on the quality of research and graduates produced in the fields of agriculture, STEM, and related academic areas. These schools are to be applauded for the significant contributions they have made to our nation.    However, the Committee is concerned regarding the financial challenges the schools continue to face, particularly, the lack of state matching funds and other resources. The Department is directed to develop and submit a plan of action to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate not later than  days after enactment of this Act to cooperatively work with the states to meet the matching grant requirements for research and extension activities.    National Nutrition Research Roadmap.--The Committee notes that the Interagency Committee on Human Nutrition Research (ICHNR) is requesting public input on the draft National Nutrition Research Roadmap -: Advancing Nutrition Research to Improve and Sustain Health. The ICHNR includes representatives from across all Federal agencies and recognized the need for a written plan to coordinate Federal human nutrition research activities. As the roadmap is finalized and implemented, it is critical that all research be conducted with a balanced approach and be free from bias. Furthermore, there must be coordination amongst all Federal agencies to prevent duplication of efforts and resources. The Secretary must ensure that there is greater coordination of nutrition research within USDA to include short- and long-term outcome measures; establishment of milestones to measure short and long-term success; alignment of resources with milestones and goals; an open and competitive process in the award of contracts, grants, and awards; and a clearer path between the application of data and knowledge gained by such research to the applicable audiences.    Within the REE mission area alone, USDA estimates spending approximately  million in fiscal year  on human nutrition research. Billions of dollars have been spent on human nutrition research government-wide in recent years, yet the impact and results are questionable since obesity rates remain high. The Committee expects the ICHNR to include research that will help Americans make positive lifestyle changes and reduce obesity rates.    The Committee is also aware that FNS conducts research and evaluation projects without full coordination with the REE mission area. Bill and report language have been included to bring more oversight to FNS' work in these areas and ensure the REE mission area is engaged in this process. FNS projects will likely have less duplication and greater cost effectiveness and efficiency by working with the REE mission area to develop and finalize the FNS Research and Evaluation Plan submitted each fiscal year.    Office of Pest Management Policy.--The Committee commends the Office of Pest Management Policy for its work providing the Department, other Federal agencies, producers, and other interested stakeholders scientifically sound analysis of pest management issues important to agriculture, especially methyl bromide transition, pesticide resistance management, and the development of antimicrobials to combat citrus greening. The Committee encourages the Under Secretary to better utilize this office and directs ARS to continue to support its vital work.    Pollinators and Colony Health Research.--The Committee recognizes that Colony Collapse Disorder and related colony health issues are a significant concern to beekeepers, honey producers, farmers, researchers, policymakers, and the public and appreciates USDA's logical, scientifically based approach to studying these issues. The Committee directs the Department to continue to focus on the challenges facing pollinators.    Potato Research.--The Committee supports research efforts to combat crop-threatening pest and disease pressures including the potato cyst nematode. The Committee also recognizes the importance of research initiatives to improve and identify desired traits for new potato varieties and directs the Department to continue working with universities, industry and potato growers on these projects."

The Committee does not concur with the agency's proposed closures, redirections of research programs, or increases for fiscal year .    Animal Research.--The Committee was disturbed to read the January , , New York Times article titled ``U.S. Research Lab Lets Livestock Suffer in Quest for Profit'' about MARC in Clay Center, Nebraska. The article made numerous allegations about the treatment of animals at MARC and described how the staff at MARC was not following ARS policies and procedures regarding the care of animals used in research.    The Committee understands that more information is needed to fully assess the details of the specific instances mentioned in the article. It also believes that ARS scientists sincerely care about the animals they work with. However, the Committee continues to be deeply disappointed in the Department's response and must take action to ensure the welfare of all animals used in research at ARS facilities. The Committee recognizes the need for and value of animal research, but it demands that all animals will be treated humanely, no type of abuse or mistreatment will be tolerated, and that the risk of premature death will be limited wherever possible.    As such, the Committee includes bill language to withhold  percent () of ARS' appropriations for fiscal year  until the Department certifies in writing to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate that ARS has updated its animal care policies and all ARS research facilities which conduct animal research have fully functioning, including all appropriate and necessary record-keeping, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) in place.    The Committee directs ARS to execute an agreement with APHIS within  days of enactment of this Act by which APHIS will conduct inspections that are consistent with the Animal Welfare Act at each ARS research facility that uses animals in research. Inspection reports shall be provided to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate immediately after they are completed. The Committee provides funding within the APHIS budget to cover the costs anticipated with this new responsibility. The Committee further directs the Department to provide a report at the same time it submits its fiscal year  budget request regarding implementation of this directive and the findings of the APHIS inspections.    In addition, the Committee is very concerned that the failure by USDA to ensure that MARC had a functioning IACUC indicates that there was a total lapse in management at every level. Instead of addressing that failure, the department's response appears to be to add new staff to do work that should have been done by existing staff.    The Committee directs ARS to conduct a full review of the easy care sheep research project currently underway at MARC. ARS should engage all stakeholders, including producers, industry and animal welfare experts. The Committee requests that ARS begin the review as soon as possible, but no later than August , , and directs the agency to submit a report about the review by February , . It should include the status of the existing project and any concerns, commendations and recommendations regarding the projects and the agency's actions.    Given the size and scope of MARC and the number of animals used in research at the location, the Committee directs ARS to consider hiring a second attending veterinarian for the Center. ARS should use existing resources to cover the cost of this position.    The Committee requests a detailed report on all of the actions taken by ARS to respond to the allegations in the article, including actions taken to correct any deficiencies or improve current policies and procedures. This report should be submitted to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate, by October , .    Aerial Application Research.--The Committee recognizes the importance of the ARS Aerial Application Technology Program. The program conducts innovative research making aerial applications more efficient, effective, and precise. Research for aerial application serves the public good as a vital tool for the future, as agriculture strives to meet the food, fiber, and bio-energy demands of a growing population.    Alfalfa Research.--The Committee supports research into alfalfa seed and forage systems which hold the potential to increase yields and milk production and improve genetics.    Aquatic Animal Health.--The Committee supports ARS' work with land-grant universities and other Federal partners to develop solutions to aquatic animal pathogens including Aeromonas in catfish and viral hemorrhagic septicemia in finfish. ARS is encouraged to collaborate with industry stakeholders on the development of potential vaccines and therapeutants.    Citrus Greening Disease Research.--The Committee commends ARS' research efforts on citrus greening disease and encourages the agency to continue working to develop methods to reduce transmission and enhance immunity in citrus trees and to work with industry, universities, growers, and other partners to develop effective control mechanisms. The Committee also encourages ARS to coordinate its efforts with the Multi-Agency Coordination group.    Co-Location of Researchers.--The Committee encourages ARS to develop a plan to maximize its investments in plant science facilities and research by taking advantage of the synergies and efficiencies realized through the co-location of USDA researchers in state-of-the-art facilities with university and other stakeholders.    Cranberry Research.--The Committee recognizes the ongoing research needs of the cranberry sector, ranging from disease control to pesticide use to responsible management of water resources. The Committee urges ARS to continue these efforts.    Domestic and Bighorn Sheep.--The Committee recognizes the challenges caused by infectious disease problems arising from wildlife-domestic animal agriculture interactions, particularly between domestic sheep and wild bighorn sheep. The Committee encourages ARS to work to determine the role of domestic sheep in causing die-offs of bighorn sheep from respiratory disease and develop methods to reduce transmission and enhance immunity.    Emerging Cereal Rust Diseases.--The Committee continues to be concerned about emerging cereal rust diseases, particularly Ug, and the threat they pose to domestic and world food supplies. The Committee encourages ARS to continue its work on these diseases, including the development of Ug-resistant wheat varieties.    Forest Products Research.--The forest products sector is an important part of the U.S. economy. The Committee supports research on wood quality, forest product evaluation standards and valuation techniques, developing pest and disease-resistant trees, and ARS' continuing work with the Forest Products Laboratory.    FOV Race  Cotton Research.--The Committee recognizes the serious threat that fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Vasinfectum (FOV), particularly the strain FOV Race , poses to the U.S. cotton industry. The Committee encourages ARS to continue research efforts to combat FOV Race  and to work with industry and other partners to develop effective control measures to eradicate this disease and prevent its spread nationwide.    Germplasm Enhancement of Maize.--The Committee supports the germplasm enhancement of maize project and encourages continued cooperation between ARS and industry.    Horticultural Research and Education.--The Committee recognizes the importance of the U.S. National Arboretum and its role as a center of discovery and education, as well as a destination for more than half a million visitors every year. The Committee encourages the agency to continue to support the Arboretum.    Human Nutrition Research.--There is strong evidence that nutrition plays a vital role in maintaining health throughout the lifespan and preventing obesity and chronic diseases. The Committee encourages ARS to continue research relating to obesity prevention strategies and the effect of nutrition on aging.    Lower Mississippi River Basin.--The Committee recognizes the groundwater problems in the Lower Mississippi River Basin and encourages ARS to continue research to quantify how appropriate use of conservation practices and technology affect water quality and quantity.    National Agricultural Library.--The Committee requests that ARS maintain a focus on agriculture-related legal issues within the National Agricultural Library. The Committee recognizes agriculture-related legal issues are being litigated on an increasingly frequent basis, the complexity and scope of these legal issues continues to broaden, and that the National Agricultural Library plays an important role in assisting all stakeholders with understanding these issues.    Porcine Virus Research.--The Committee is aware of ongoing research to identify mechanisms of viral pathogenesis, transmission, and immunity to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) and encourages ARS to continue its efforts to identify the genetic virulence factors of PEDv, identify a protective immune response including transmission of maternal antibodies through the milk, and evaluate new vaccine platforms for the development of improved PEDv vaccines.    Pulse Health Initiative.--The Committee is aware of the need to investigate the ability of pulse crops, such as dry beans, dry peas, lentils, and chickpeas, to provide solutions to critical health issues and to improve the sustainability of crop rotations by improving the nitrogen-fixing abilities of pulse crops. The Committee encourages ARS to continue its work on these important issues.    Sage Grouse.--The Committee is aware that listing the greater sage grouse as endangered under the Endangered Species Act has the potential to negatively affect rural communities in the  states that have sage brush ecosystems. The Committee encourages ARS to work with its partners on sage brush and related rangeland research that will help preserve the greater sage grouse and the other species that rely on the sage brush ecosystem.    Sclerotinia Initiative.--The Committee is aware of the importance of controlling Sclerotinia in sunflowers, soybeans, canola, edible beans, peanuts, peas, lentils, and chickpeas and encourages ARS to continue its support of this initiative.    Small Grain Genomics.--The Committee supports research on small grain genomics and recognizes its importance in improving crop traits and developing new cultivars.    U.S. Sheep Experiment Station (USSES).--The USSES provides valuable information to increase the production efficiency of sheep, improve sustainable rangeland ecosystems and expand other research initiatives. The Committee encourages ARS to work with stakeholders regarding efforts to propose mission improvements for the experiment station.    U.S. Wheat and Barley Scab.--The Committee recognizes the fusarium head blight is a major threat to agriculture, inflicting substantial yield and quality losses throughout the U.S. The Committee supports research carried out through the U.S. Wheat and Barley Scab Initiative."

Agricultural Research Enhancement Awards.--The Committee directs that not less than  percent of the competitive research grant funds be used for USDA's agriculture research enhancement awards program, including USDA-EPSCoR, in accordance with  U.S.C. i.    Antimicrobial Resistance.--The Committee provides an increase of  million for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) for research to combat antimicrobial resistance. In addition, the Committee directs NIFA to include an additional . million of base funding to the program's current level of . million, for a total investment of  million in research on combating antimicrobial resistance.    Budget Request for Fiscal Year .--The Committee appreciates NIFA's efforts to provide additional information in its budget requests over the past three years. For the fiscal year  budget request, the Committee is particularly interested in the request for AFRI, and requests that the agency provide greater detail on the levels proposed to be allocated to and the expected publication date, scope, and allocation level for each request for awards to be published under each priority area specified in section (b)() of the Competitive, Special, and Facilities Research Grant Act ( U.S.C. i(b)()).    Citrus Disease Research Program.--The  farm bill established the Emergency Citrus Disease Research and Extension Program, which is intended to discover and develop tools for early detection, control, and eradication of diseases and pests that threaten domestic citrus production and processing, and provided  million per year in mandatory funding for the program through the Specialty Crop Research Initiative. The Committee believes research projects funded under this authority should be prioritized based on the critical threat of citrus greening and encourages NIFA, to the maximum extent practicable, to follow the recommendations of the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Advisory Board's citrus disease subcommittee and to collaborate with the Huanglongbing Multi-Agency Coordination group.    Classical Plant Breeding.--The Committee is aware of the need for classical plant breeding and encourages NIFA to invest in research to improve genetic resources and cultivars for the benefit of U.S. producers, seed companies, processors, and consumers. This research should focus on breeding improved germplasm and varieties with higher yields, improved disease and pest resistance, and resilience to weather extremes. Additionally, methods and tools should be developed to enable classical breeders to choose better breeding parents and speed up variety development.    Livestock and Poultry Waste Research.--The Committee recognizes the benefits of improved methods of managing animal waste in livestock and poultry production and encourages NIFA to support research and development of innovative technologies, particularly those that are operationally and economically feasible and have a high probability of widespread implementation.    National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN).--The laboratories within the NAHLN network provide a critical contribution to animal and public health in the detection of newly identified and reemerging animal diseases. NIFA provides funding for NAHLN laboratory infrastructure. The fiscal year  appropriations Act provided funding for NAHLN through both APHIS and NIFA at approximately  million and  million, respectively. In addition to these base funds, USDA has spent millions of dollars in fiscal year  to reimburse laboratories in the NAHLN network for work with the HPAI outbreak. The bill continues this base funding and includes an additional  million for APHIS to support NAHLN, resulting in a total investment of  million for fiscal year .    Organic Agriculture.--The Economic Research Service has cited industry statistics that ``organic sales account for over four percent of total U.S. food sales.'' The Committee encourages USDA to ensure that the needs of the U.S. organic sector are more fully addressed through AFRI and to report back to the Committee with a plan for meeting this goal, including how the agency will ensure organic research conducted through AFRI is not duplicative of research conducted with mandatory funds through the Organic Agriculture Research and Extension Initiative and other research programs.    Research at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions.--The Committee encourages NIFA to continue to support biotechnology by promoting research at the land-grant colleges and universities, including the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions, and directs NIFA to encourage partnerships among universities and industry.    Zoonotic Disease Research.--The eradication of zoonotic livestock diseases has been a priority of Federal and state animal health officials, as was reflected in the  farm bill. The Committee recognizes the need for this research and encourages NIFA to support the development of improved management tools for zoonotic livestock diseases that have significant wildlife reservoirs.

Budgetary Reductions.--FSA has submitted consecutive proposals for significant annual budget savings through ``operational efficiencies'' with little detail for achieving these goals. FSA proposed nearly  million in reductions for fiscal year . While the Committee adopts some reductions for  over fiscal year , this is a reflection of the increased need in fiscal year  for farm bill implementation. The Committee is also cognizant of remaining balances from the additional  million in mandatory funding provided through the  farm bill that supplements these reductions in . In particular, the Committee does not accept the proposed savings for non-Federal workers or other personnel savings, and the Committee supports full staffing levels for non-Federal workers. The Committee provides for proposed increases in IT while requiring stringent oversight in the bill through the Comptroller General. As the Committee noted in fiscal year , FSA is directed to provide detailed documentation and data when proposing such significant savings in future budget requests.    Beginning Farmers and Ranchers.--The Committee does not fund requested increases for Beginning Farmer and Rancher programs. This is due to a lack of coordination and strategy across the Department per USDA OIG report --. USDA already spends  million on these programs. The Committee directs the Secretary to implement the recommendations of the OIG before requesting further increases in funding.    International Food Aid Commodity Reports.--The Committee directs FSA to make publicly available reports detailing U.S. Commodities purchased for international food aid similar to those published in fiscal years  and . These reports identified U.S. international food aid by type, country, program, value, and region. The Committee also directs FSA to include the amount, value, destination, and type of commodity shipped by U.S. port of origination.    Proposal to Close County Offices.--The Committee expects FSA to complete its workload study of FSA county offices and an independent review to examine the study before FSA closes any offices. The Committee directs FSA to complete this study promptly and includes statutory language preventing the closure of these offices.    FSA IT.--FSA's management of certain IT projects has produced increased costs, bloated budgets, and inaccurate budget estimates. These projects include the MIDAS program and increased or inaccurate charges from the National Information Technology Center, for which costs have tripled since fiscal year . The agreement includes statutory language that allows FSA to release funds for farm program delivery IT projects only after review by the GAO and approval by the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate. The roadmap submitted by FSA in fiscal year  was the first step to bringing accountability and guidance to almost a decade of mismanagement. In this regard, the GAO and the OIG are recommending that FSA establish a plan to guide the agency in adopting recognized best practices and in following agency policy. The GAO also recommends that the agency adhere to specific practices within key management disciplines before proceeding with further system development. FSA is directed to continue quarterly briefings in writing for the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate regarding all IT projects and activities related to farm program delivery.    Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC).--The Committee urges FSA to explore further cooperation on technologies that could benefit American agricultural conservation practices and crop yield through FGDC partners, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."

The Committee is pleased with the results of CEAP and the agency's efforts to modernize the delivery of conservation programs and services through CDSI and encourages the continuation of these efforts.    Administrative Reorganization.--The Committee commends NRCS for its organizational realignment of administrative functions and appreciates the savings this will generate. NRCS has worked to become a more efficient, accountable organization, and the Committee encourages NRCS to work with other agencies within USDA to do the same.    Agricultural Conservation Easement Program.--Due to the unique ecological needs of each State, the Committee encourages NRCS to work with state and local partners to address these needs and to ensure the priority needs and projects in each State, such as those that are leveraged by public and private resources, are addressed, as appropriate.    Cheat Grass Eradication.--The Committee encourages NRCS to continue to assist farmers and ranchers to eradicate, control, and reduce the fuel loads associated with cheat grass and to collaborate with ARS, as appropriate, on research related to cheat grass.    Conservation Practice Standards.--The Committee is aware that NRCS has been pressured to modify its conservation practice standards in certain circumstances for purposes not related to the conservation of farm and ranch land. The Committee recognizes that conservation practice standards are science-based, undergo a thorough technical review, are open to the public for notice and comment, and reflect the best available knowledge on how to achieve the identified conservation and environmental objective. The Committee directs NRCS to maintain its long-standing process for developing and updating its conservation practice standards.    Data Collection.--The Committee recommends continued investment from NRCS for light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data collection for the LiDAR-Enhanced Soil Survey (LESS) model and other such activities within NRCS reliant on mapping, surveying and geospatial technologies, data, and products.    Harmful Algal Blooms.--The Committee supports NRCS' ongoing work to prevent soil erosion leading to harmful algal blooms through the introduction of cover crops, and encourages continued targeting of watersheds where harmful algal blooms pose a threat.    Herbicide Resistance.--The Committee reminds NRCS of the challenges many producers are facing due to the spread of herbicide-resistant weeds and encourages it to ensure agency staff, partners, and producers are aware of conservation practice standards and conservation activity plans to address herbicide-resistant weeds, and that financial assistance through certain conservation programs is available to assist producers in their efforts to control these weeds.    Locally Led Conservation.--The Committee recognizes that locally led conservation is the foundation of the Nation's highly successful legacy of conservation and encourages NRCS to work with State, Tribal, local, and other partners on voluntary stewardship projects that preserve working agricultural lands while protecting watersheds and wildlife habitat.    Loess Streambed Degradation.--The Committee encourages NRCS to provide technical assistance in implementing streambed stabilization practices and grade control structures on streams in areas affected by loess deposits.    National Marine Sanctuaries.--The Committee urges the agency to continue the collaborative agreement with the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries to address agricultural sources of runoff, such as sediments, nitrates, and pesticides.    Resource Conservation and Development Councils (RC&Ds).--The Committee recognizes RC&Ds have been valuable partners in conservation and encourages NRCS to continue working with local councils, as appropriate, to ensure conservation programs meet local resource needs.    Sage Grouse Initiative.--The Committee supports NRCS' sage grouse conservation efforts. Through the initiative, NRCS provides technical and financial assistance to help landowners conserve sage grouse habitat on their land. The initiative is an integral part of efforts by Federal agencies, several western states, and private landowners to help preclude the listing of the sage grouse as an endangered species.    Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Plan.--NRCS has not yet established a long-term, multi-year plan to guide needed investments in watershed surveys and planning and watershed operations as directed in House Report -. The Committee directs NRCS to complete this plan as soon as possible, taking into consideration existing investment in planning, infrastructure, and land treatment and future needs for investment to improve watershed condition or prevent or mitigate watershed impairments.    Water Use Efficiency.--The Committee is encouraged by the work being undertaken by the Bureau of Reclamation and NRCS under the California Bay-Delta Program Water Use Efficiency Grants Program, which coordinates the water use efficiency assistance authorized under the Secure Water Act.

StrikeForce Initiative.--The Committee appreciates the Department's efforts to target assistance to at-risk communities through the StrikeForce Initiative for Rural Growth and Opportunity. USDA, in collaboration with public and private partners, helps rural counties experiencing chronic poverty improve economic opportunities and quality of life for local residents. The Committee encourages USDA to place special emphasis on persistent poverty counties and continue to utilize a strategy of partnering public resources with local expertise to grow rural economies and create jobs in these poverty-stricken areas."

Water Supplies for Very Small Communities.--The Committee is aware of concerns that the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) grant programs do not adequately help small, disadvantaged, and severely disadvantaged communities access the funding and expertise necessary to develop sustainable water supplies or otherwise improve their wastewater systems and directs the agency to focus its efforts to assist these communities with predevelopment planning to help them address their water supply needs.    Carryover Balances for AK, HI, and Colonias Grants.--The Committee is aware of significant carryover balances of unobligated funds provided in prior year appropriations for Water and Waste Disposal grants for Alaskan villages, Native American Tribes, Hawaiian Homelands, and the Colonias. The Committee urges the Department to work with state, local and Indian tribal organization stakeholders to provide assistance via water and waste disposal grant programs as long as such assistance is requested by the respective groups in the year in which the funds were appropriated. The Department has flexibility to shift these prior year funds among the four areas through a reprogramming of funds. Further, the Committee provides flexibility in fiscal year  to move funds to other water and waste disposal priorities in order to reduce the backlog of related needs nationwide.    Open and Free Competition Policy.--The Committee supports the Department's underlying adherence to free and open competition on water and waste projects as contained in  CFR .(b) and (d). However, there continues to be confusion with some vendors and contractors as to the procurement policies of specific materials. The Committee encourages USDA's Rural Utilities Service to issue a memorandum as necessary to clarify that the agency does not advocate for one product over another and that the agency will ensure the best options for the respective communities in accordance with the technical requirements proposed by engineers and design professionals.

The Committee notes that tribal communities continue to struggle with gaining access to broadband service. The Committee encourages the Secretary to provide a report that identifies the specific challenges Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs) have in gaining access to broadband service and provide a plan for addressing these challenges, including how the Community Connect program can assist ITOs."
570,114-205 H.txt,    For the Office of the Under Secretary for Food,"    For the Office of the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services, the Committee provides an appropriation of .    Research and Evaluations.--The Committee is concerned that research and evaluation projects conducted by FNS do not include more coordination with the Research, Education, and Economics (REE) mission area. The Committee is also concerned that the FNS Research and Evaluation Plan is released well after funding has already been provided for the fiscal year, making it difficult for the Committee to exercise its oversight responsibility. Section  states that FNS cannot receive any funding for research and evaluation projects in fiscal year  until the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate receive the fiscal year  Research and Evaluation Plan that has been developed in coordination with the REE mission area.    In submitting the fiscal year  and subsequent fiscal year budget justifications, FNS is directed to provide its Research and Evaluation Plan simultaneously with its budget request. FNS is further directed to coordinate and finalize its plan with the REE mission area in fiscal year  and each fiscal year thereafter. The plan submitted for fiscal years  and subsequent fiscal years shall include a brief description of the projects FNS expects to pursue, the total projected cost of each project, whether it will be done in-house or contracted out, and whether it was mandated by law or not. By coordinating this plan with the REE mission area, FNS projects will be more cost effective, efficient and reduce duplication.    Communication from FNS.--The Committee recognizes the efforts made to increase communication and reduce delays by FNS in completing requested reports. Reports requested by the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate, as well as information regarding FNS programs, are an important part of the Committees' oversight responsibilities. The directives and issues that are specified in the House, Senate, or conference report are very important to the Committee, and dates are mandatory. FNS is expected to keep the Committee apprised of activities and issues, especially those mentioned in Committee reports. FNS is reminded that the Committee reserves the right to call before it any agency that does not submit reports on time.    Public Release of Information.--The Committee directs FNS to continue making all policy documents related to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program (including, but not limited to, instructions, memoranda, guidance, and questions and answers) available to the public on the Internet within one week of their release to state WIC administrators.    Program Eligibility.--The Committee directs FNS to work with states to ensure full compliance with the law that all WIC and SNAP participants meet all program eligibility requirements. FNS also is directed to ensure these programs are not being promoted to ineligible individuals, which would increase program costs.    Fruit and Vegetable Consumption.--The Dietary Guidelines for Americans emphasize that Americans should consume more fruits and vegetables in all of their forms. In order to maximize the value of the benefits nutrition program participants receive, the Committee urges FNS to recognize in relevant agency publications and regulations related to all Federal nutrition programs, including nutrition education programs and child nutrition programs, the nutritional benefits provided by all forms of fruits, vegetables, and beans, whether canned, dried, fresh, or frozen."
571,114-205 H.txt,    For the Child Nutrition Programs,"    For the Child Nutrition Programs, the Committee provides .    Summer EBT.--The Committee includes funding for the summer electronic benefit transfer (EBT) pilot projects and notes that the  agriculture appropriations Act provided the initial funding for demonstration projects to test various methods of providing food for low-income children during the summer months. The pilots have been ongoing for five years. If the pilots have been successful, the Secretary is encouraged to work through the authorization process to establish a summer EBT program rather than continue with pilot projects.    School Equipment.--The Committee provides funding for school meals equipment grants and directs the Department to provide a report that details the type of equipment that has been purchased by schools including but not limited to salad bars and equipment used to prepare foods offered on salad bars. The report should also include whether Federal Acquisition Regulations prevent schools from purchasing needed equipment or disqualify certain equipment purchases utilizing the school meals equipment grant program. If these, or any other regulations or requirements are impediments, the report should provide recommended solutions to ensure schools are able to procure a variety of needed equipment.    School Meals.--The Committee remains concerned about the challenges and costs that local schools face in implementing the various regulations from the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of . Some schools are continuing to have difficulty complying with the whole grain requirements that went into effect on July , , and there continues to be concern with further reductions in the sodium requirements for school meals. The Committee appreciates the Secretary providing guidance to the states so they can establish a process to exempt school food authorities demonstrating a hardship from the current whole grain standards, as required by the fiscal year  appropriations Act. This flexibility is extended for the - school year. The Committee also retains bill language from the fiscal year  appropriations Act requiring that sodium standards cannot be reduced below Target  until the latest scientific research establishes the reduction is beneficial for children.    As schools seek to implement the school meal standards, the Committee encourages USDA to consider ways to assist schools with technical assistance and training, including the services of not-for-profit culinary institutions, to provide healthy, cost-effective foods that students will eat.    The Committee directs FNS, in coordination with AMS, to issue guidance to school food authorities clarifying that commodities purchased with cash reimbursement funding must be bought in accordance with the Buy American Act, which contains exceptions for domestic product availability and price considerations. Such guidance can assist school food authorities in supplying products, such as canned tuna and other items, from private vendors while adhering to the Buy American Act.    Improper Payments.--The Committee remains concerned about the staggering error rates for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP), which were about  percent and  percent, respectively, in fiscal year . This amounts to . billion in improper payments for NSLP and  million for SBP. The OIG completed an audit report in May  to evaluate how FNS has attempted to lower the error rates for NSLP and SBP. OIG made recommendations such as requiring households to provide proof of income when submitting an application for free or reduced-price meals and that school food authorities should verify questionable applications. The Committee directs FNS to provide a report on how the agency will implement the recommendations made by OIG.    The following table reflects the Committee recommendations for the child nutrition programs:"

However, the average monthly participation rate was . million for fiscal year , and the current average for fiscal year  is . million. This data indicates that the actual trajectory of WIC participation continues to decline. Birth rates also remain at an all-time low according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.    USDA is estimating recovery and carryover funds to be approximately  million. Furthermore, the Secretary has a sufficient WIC contingency reserve fund as a safety net to meet unexpected demand. With lower participation rates, higher carryover funds, and an ample reserve fund, the Committee provides funding that will ensure all eligible participants will be served. The Committee will continue to monitor WIC participation, carryover funds, and food costs and take additional action as necessary to ensure that funding provided in fiscal year  remains sufficient to serve all eligible applicants.    The Committee provides for continuation of the breastfeeding peer counselor program, infrastructure, and investments in management information systems including WIC EBT systems. The Committee continues to support transitioning WIC paper checks and vouchers to an EBT system. EBT is a proven, effective tool in combatting waste, fraud, and abuse. These funds will help WIC state agencies meet the statutory requirement to have an EBT system in place by October , .    The Committee appreciates the Secretary's timely implementation of Section  of the fiscal year  agriculture appropriations Act. WIC participants may now choose from all varieties of fresh fruits and vegetables. The Committee recognizes that the required review of the WIC food package is currently underway and directs USDA to keep the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate apprised as this process continues.    Income Eligibility Standards.--The Committee continues to monitor WIC income eligibility standards to ensure all procedures are followed by the WIC state and local agencies. USDA is directed to provide a report on the continuing efforts to ensure that only those households with incomes at or below  percent of the Federal poverty level are enrolled in the WIC program and that state and local agencies adhere to the income verification procedures that the Department has implemented. In the case of individuals who are adjunctively eligible for the program through Medicaid, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program or SNAP, the Committee encourages USDA to explore the use of income verification mechanisms already in use by State Medicaid programs, TANF and SNAP to enroll in the program those with household incomes consistent with the low income, nutritionally at risk enrollment goals of the WIC program.    Cost Management within WIC State Agencies.--The Committee is aware of an OIG audit report issued in September of  stating that FNS has worked with state agencies to reduce food costs, but further steps could be taken. This report makes recommendations that could benefit the program such as coordinating with Medicaid for the potential program reimbursement for prescribed infant formulas and medical foods and evaluating cost containment measures in states with the lowest food costs to potentially expand successful initiatives nationwide. The Committee directs USDA to submit a report describing how they have responded to each of OIG's recommendations.    Fraudulent Activities.--The Committee remains concerned that some individuals are selling WIC benefits or WIC-purchased infant formula or food items on social media sites and by other means, which is a violation of Federal WIC regulations. During a Congressional hearing, the GAO also expressed concern with this type of online fraud. The Committee directs FNS to provide a report within  days of enactment of this Act describing how the agency is addressing this abuse and coordinating with state and local officials to prevent these activities."
573,114-205 H.txt,    For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,"    For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Committee provides . The total amount includes  for a contingency reserve to be used only in the amount necessary. The Committee does not support funding to establish Centers of Excellence or conduct unauthorized activities, which leads to an expectation that future funds will be provided to support activities and centers not authorized by Congress.    The Committee is aware that FNS is preparing a report describing purchases made by SNAP recipients as compared to non-SNAP recipients. FNS is directed to complete this report as soon as practicable and make this report publicly available.    Employment Verification.--The  farm bill requires state agencies to use the National Directory of New Hires (NDNH) to verify wage and employment information. As of March , only  states have completed the process and are conducting matches using NDNH. The Committee directs USDA to continue working with the remaining states to complete the process and implement the use of NDNH as soon as practicable.    Recruitment Activities.--The Committee continues to direct USDA to ensure Section  of the  farm bill is implemented and enforced in a manner consistent with the statute which prohibits USDA from conducting recruitment activities, advertising the program, and from entering into agreements with foreign governments to promote SNAP benefits. The Committee continues to direct USDA to enforce this provision to ensure state agencies are not reimbursed for similar activities consistent with the statute.    Issuance of SNAP Benefits.--The Committee notes that some states issue SNAP benefits to recipients in a compressed time frame, usually at the beginning of the month, which causes challenges for both SNAP participants and retailers. The Committee recognizes that other states issue benefits on different days throughout the month, which allows SNAP retailers to stock a consistent supply of food items to ensure participants have access to a variety of foods. The Committee directs FNS to work with those states with a compressed issuance schedule to provide benefits in a manner that will help SNAP retailers provide recipients with a steady supply of healthy food, and to report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate progress made on this issue within  days of enactment of this Act.    The following table reflects the Committee recommendations for SNAP:"

For the Food Donations Programs, the Committee provides an appropriation of  for Pacific Island Assistance.    TEFAP Handling and Distribution Costs.--In addition to the grant funds to support commodity handling and distribution costs, the bill permits states to use up to  percent of the funds provided for purchasing TEFAP commodities to help with the costs of storing, transporting, and distributing commodities. The Committee expects state agencies to consult with their emergency feeding organizations on the need for the conversion of such funds."
575,114-205 H.txt,    For Nutrition Programs Administration,"    For Nutrition Programs Administration, the Committee provides .    The Committee does not provide funding for the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion to develop Federal dietary guidance for infants and children from birth to  months of age or to promote the Dietary Guidelines for Americans or MyPlate. The nutrition education services provided through WIC, along with other Federal nutrition education programs, are available to assist with the dietary and nutritional needs of infants and children. The Committee also notes that USDA does significant advertising of the Dietary Guidelines, MyPlate, and other resources to promote healthier lifestyles. These efforts are combined with the ``Let's Move!'' campaign and use of this information by the public and private sectors.    Dietary Guidelines for Americans.--There continues to be concern with the  Dietary Guidelines for Americans advisory committee (DGAC) recommendations. The fiscal year  explanatory statement stated that Congress expected the Secretary to ensure that the DGAC remained focused on nutrient and dietary recommendations based upon sound nutrition science. However, the DGAC report released February , , included extraneous factors and policy recommendations that are outside of the statutory requirement, such as agriculture production practices including sustainability, taxes, food labeling and marketing policies. This was the first time environmental factors impacted recommendations traditionally aimed at diet and nutrition. Questions have been raised regarding the scientific evidence and scientific process used to make the recommendations.    The Committee considers the scientific integrity of the Dietary Guidelines to be fundamental to Federal nutrition policy that best advances public health. Therefore, bill language is included to ensure both the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of HHS use the most rigorous and objective science through the Nutrition Evidence Library (NEL) and that the final report adheres to the statutory authority of providing diet and nutrition information only. The Committee also expects the Departments to ensure the final guidelines do not conflict with sound scientific, nutritional guidance implemented by other federal agencies outside of USDA and HHS.    USDA and HHS received more than , comments during the public comment period for the DGAC report. Given the unprecedented number of comments and the fact that the DGAC included recommendations beyond its nutritional purview, greater transparency is needed as the Departments finalize the guidelines. The public will have no other opportunity to provide input or understand what the Departments might recommend before they release the final guidelines. Therefore, bill language directs the Departments to revise and publish the preliminary draft of the guidelines. The public notice shall also include a list of the specific scientific studies and evidence that has been rated ``Grade I: Strong'' by the NEL supporting each revised or new recommendation. Finally, the Secretaries shall allow for a minimum  day public comment period of the revised recommendations, and finalization shall not occur until at least  days after the comment period to allow the Departments time to review the comments."

Swap Dealer de Minimis.--The Committee notes the Commission's decision to provide for a public comment period on the study related to the Swap Dealer de Minimis level. While this is a positive step by the Commission in providing certainty to market end-users, it does not entirely comply with the letter of the directive in Public Law -. The Committee directs the Commission to promulgate a rulemaking either maintaining the Swap Dealer de Minimis threshold at  the amount currently set forth in regulation, or above this amount pursuant to the results of the study currently being conducted as well as stakeholder input, within  days of enactment of this Act.    Commission Staff.--The Committee reminds the Commission of its responsibility when making commitments under current law, including the Antideficiency Act. As the GAO's Principles on Appropriations Law states ``The fiscal principles inherent in the Antideficiency Act are really quite simple. Government officials may not make payments or commit the United States to make payments at some future time for goods or services unless there is enough money in the `bank' to cover the cost in full. The `bank', of course, is the available appropriation.'' The Committee is aware of ongoing negotiations between the Commission and labor unions to arrive at a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). During these negotiations, the fundamental concept of spending within one's known and available means comes into play. The Commission must not make commitments within the CBA based upon budget requests or projections of spending but upon its current funding situation. Alternatively, if the Commission makes firm commitments to higher expenses in the near and long term, they risk having to reduce spending elsewhere in the current budget or not having funds to maintain current staffing levels. Any CBA must reflect budgetary realities and management of current funds must not jeopardize Commission staff. The Committee directs the Commission to not increase personnel costs, either through excessive hiring, budgetary mismanagement, or CBA negotiations, that would risk any furloughs, reductions-in-force, or expected compensation for its hardworking staff.    Leasing Costs.--The Committee notes reviews by the Inspector General regarding excessive leasing costs and a projection of  million wasted on vacant space. This does not include approximately  million already spent on vacant space since . A secondary review is being conducted by the GAO at the request of the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate. The Committee directs the Commission, in accordance with the President's ``Reduce the Federal Footprint'' initiative, to find ways to decrease space and renegotiate leasing agreements. The Committee also provides the Commission and taxpayer budgetary relief through direction in the bill to utilize rental credits of  million provided by the Commission's landlord.    CFTC-SEC Cooperation.--The Committee directs the Commission to work cooperatively with the Securities and Exchange Commission on all joint rulemakings as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.    Internal Risk Management Transactions.--The Committee is concerned that there is a lack of global coordination among regulators on the treatment of internal trades between affiliated entities. The Committee notes that international bodies left this to the discretion of national governments. As such, European and Japanese rules provide an exemption from margin requirements, with certain conditions, for internal trades between affiliates. In contrast, the U.S. market has proposed rules that would impose margin requirements on these trades. The Committee notes this will discourage prudent risk management by increasing the costs of these trades. These costs will be borne by the customers and result in reduced liquidity. The Committee urges the CFTC to recognize that such internal risk management transactions benefit customers. These requirements will result in regulatory arbitrage across jurisdictions. The Committee directs the Commission to report to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress, within  days of enactment of this Act, on the impact of the proposed rules on consumers and industries."

583,114-531 H.txt,    For the Office of the Secretary,"    For the Office of the Secretary, the Committee provides an appropriation of . The Committee recommendation includes the following offices under the Office of the Secretary: immediate Office of the Secretary; Office of Tribal Relations; Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Coordination; Office of Advocacy and Outreach; Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration; Departmental Administration; Office of the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations; and Office of Communications.    Pay Cost.--The Committee does not include requested funding for a civilian pay increase across the Department. Should the President provide a civilian pay increase for fiscal year , it is assumed that the cost of such a pay increase will be absorbed within existing appropriations for fiscal year .    Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Obligations and Commitments.--The Secretary is directed to notify the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate in writing  days prior to the obligation or commitment of any emergency funds from the CCC.    CCC Report.--The Committee directs the Secretary to provide a report on November , , and May , , on planned uses of funding under the authorities of Section  and Section  of the CCC Charter Act.    Crop Biotechnology & Biotech Ingredients.--Plants, food, and food ingredients developed using genetic engineering were introduced into the U.S. food supply in the s. Public and private sector scientists knowledgeable in genetic engineering, toxicology, chemistry, nutrition, and other scientific areas have carefully evaluated and assessed the safety of these products and have determined that such products are safe for human and animal consumption. The Committee provides a total of  for the FDA to coordinate with USDA to provide education and outreach to the public on the safety and benefits of crop biotechnology and food and animal feed ingredients derived from biotechnology. The Committee expects this educational information to be posted on both agency websites and through other social media and communications platforms within  days of enactment of this Act.    Federal Employee Conduct.--The federal government grants federal employees with tremendous responsibility and trust to carry out their duties. They must do so free from conflicts of interest and without seeking private gain. Employees are public servants charged with implementing federal programs in a legal and ethical manner. Federal employees are reminded that they shall not advance a personal agenda or give preferential treatment to any outside organization or individual within the government programs which they administer. Information that is received by the employee, including information from the employees, offices, or Committees of the Congress of the United States, should be handled in a professional and confidential manner according to the federal government's code of conduct, standards, regulations, and statutes. The Committee is aware of recent conduct in violation of these principles, and the Committee believes that it is incumbent upon agency officials to take immediate disciplinary action when they confirm such behavior.    Nutrition Research Coordination.--The Committee seeks to bring more transparency and coordination to nutrition research and evaluation projects conducted by the Department. The Secretary is directed to ensure both the Research, Education, and Economics (REE) and the Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services mission areas coordinate and finalize the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) Research and Evaluation Plan submitted in fiscal year  to prevent duplication of efforts and resources. The plan submitted for fiscal year  shall include a brief description of the projects FNS expects to pursue and whether or not it was mandated by law.    Section  states that FNS shall not receive any funding for new research and evaluation projects in fiscal year  until the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate receive the fiscal year  Research and Evaluation Plan that has been developed in coordination with REE. In submitting the fiscal year  budget justification, FNS is directed to provide its Research and Evaluation Plan simultaneously with its budget request. There is an expectation that this process will be followed in the future.    Improper Payments, Unachieved Savings, and Financial Management.--The Committee remains concerned with the Department's overall management of crucial financial issues that result in savings and efficiencies for taxpayers. This includes its consistent lack of compliance with mandatory improper payments reporting information, failure to complete OIG recommendations that would total  million in savings, and delaying the submission of financial statements for the second consecutive year.    The Department has made gradual progress on some of these issues. USDA has reduced the amount of unachieved savings identified by the IG slightly since fiscal year , and certain agencies, including the Risk Management Agency (RMA), have reduced their improper payment rates. The Committee directs the Department to properly report information related to improper payments and continue to work to reduce unachieved savings. Finally, the Department is directed to work with the Office of Management and Budget to submit financial statements on schedule for fiscal year  and correct deficiencies identified for fiscal year .    Avian Influenza.--The Committee appreciates the Department's response to the recent outbreak of HPAI, which caused considerable devastation to America's poultry industry and cost the economy well over  between the public and private sector. The Committee encourages the Department to continue its work with trading partners to reopen trade for poultry and poultry products to the greatest extent possible. The Committee will continue to closely monitor the situation and directs USDA to keep the Committee apprised of future developments.    Congressional Relations Allocation Notification.--Within  days of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall notify the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate on the allocation of the funds provided to the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations by USDA agency, along with an explanation for the agency-by-agency distribution of the funds.    State Office Co-location.--The Committee continues to direct that any reallocation of resources related to the co-location of state offices scheduled for fiscal year  and subsequent years is subject to the Committee's reprogramming procedures required under law.    Administrative Provision.--The Committee directs the Secretary to advise the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate, through the Office of Budget and Program Analysis (OBPA), of the status of all reports requested of the Department in this bill at the time of submission of the fiscal year  budget request and monthly thereafter. The Department needs to improve its timeliness in adhering to this requirement as stated in the fiscal year  and  House Appropriations reports. The Committee reminds the Secretary that all correspondence related to the directives in this bill must be addressed to the Committee on Appropriations.    Loan and Grant Programs.--The Committee directs the Department, through OBPA, to provide quarterly reports to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate on the status of obligations and funds availability for the loan and grant programs provided in this bill.    The Committee further directs that if an estimate of loan activity for any program funded in Titles I and III of this bill indicates that a limitation on authority to make commitments for a fiscal year will be reached before the end of that fiscal year, or in any event when  percent of the authority to make commitments has been utilized, the Secretary shall promptly notify the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate through OBPA.    Communication from USDA.--The Department is reminded that the Members of the Committee must be informed of the activities, pending and proposed actions, and expenditures made by USDA and its respective agencies so that Congress can determine whether laws and programs are being implemented and carried out in accordance with the intent of Congress. A collaborative working relationship between the Committee and the agencies is necessary to ensure efficient and effective implementation of Congress' funding decisions. USDA is directed to ensure the Committee is notified of major changes to existing policies and any significant developments in its operations prior to providing non-governmental stakeholders such information.    Late Reports.--The Committee reminds the Secretary that the timelines specified by the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate for fiscal year  reports are deadlines that must be met. While the Committee notes that the Department has made progress since , the Department still has several outstanding reports that are delayed due to long reviews and clearances, especially in the immediate Office of the Secretary. The Committee directs the Secretary to submit these overdue reports.    Decentralized Rent and Homeland Security.--In fiscal year , the Committee provided the Department with authority to decentralize rent from the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Secretary submitted this request ``as part of USDA's implementation of the President's `Freeze the Federal Footprint' initiative'' and to encourage efficiencies across the Department at individual agencies. On the contrary, USDA did not freeze, but expanded, its footprint by approximately , square feet. Meanwhile, the Secretary has claimed savings of  while there will be a projected increase of  since fiscal year .    The Secretary is directed to find actual savings within the total estimated costs for fiscal year , in accordance with the President's ``Reduce the Footprint'' initiative. If USDA does not find ways to reduce its physical footprint or the cost of its existing footprint, such increased costs will need to be absorbed by the agency to the detriment of the core missions of these agencies. Further, the Committee in fiscal year  directed that ``any future requests for increases to rent and security costs will need to be accompanied by detailed justifications.'' USDA has not provided such justification. The following table shows the increased costs, with the most recently available data as provided by USDA:"

Administrative Reorganization.--The Committee does not concur with the agency's proposal to combine NIFA Research and Education Activities, Extension Activities, and Integrated Activities into one account. While the Committee supports greater efficiency in the management of limited federal research dollars, the proposal fails to demonstrate that such reorganization would result in significant savings or the improvement of programs offered through NIFA.    Biological Research Stations.--The Committee directs USDA to provide a report within  days of enactment of this Act on the feasibility of establishing a new biological research station in association with a Historically Black College or University that has previously established partnerships in the conservation field. The report should examine the need for such a station, the economic and educational benefits, and associated costs.    Coffee Plant Health.--The Committee appreciates ARS and NIFA's work to address existing and emerging challenges to coffee production in the United States and commends the agency's work with research partners and coffee grower groups. The Committee encourages ARS, NIFA, and its partners to maintain support for coffee plant health research.    Office of Pest Management Policy.--The Committee commends the Office of Pest Management Policy for its work providing the Department, federal agencies, producers, and other interested stakeholders scientifically sound analysis of pest management issues important to agriculture, especially methyl bromide transition, pesticide resistance management, and the development of antimicrobials to combat citrus greening. The Committee encourages the Under Secretary to better utilize this office and directs ARS to continue to support its vital work.    Pollinators and Colony Health Research.--The Committee recognizes that Colony Collapse Disorder and related colony health issues are a significant concern to beekeepers, honey producers, farmers, researchers, policymakers, and the public. It appreciates USDA's logical, scientifically based approach to studying these issues and directs the Department to continue to focus on the challenges facing pollinators.    Potato Research.--The Committee supports research efforts to combat crop-threatening pest and disease pressures, including the potato cyst nematode. The Committee also recognizes the importance of research initiatives to identify and improve desired traits for new potato varieties and directs the Department to continue working with universities, industry and potato growers on these projects.

The Committee does not concur with the agency's proposed redirections of research programs or increases for fiscal year .    Agriculture Research Stations.--The Committee is concerned about the continued trend towards reductions in on-the-ground agriculture research through proposed cutbacks and consolidations without a clear plan to ensure that research which reflects the local needs and growing conditions continues. The Committee directs the ARS to prioritize funding for field stations and work directly with local growers as changes in local research offerings are considered.    Animal Research.--The Committee expects the Department to keep the Committee informed on the progress of implementing changes to policies and procedures as a result of the January , , New York Times article titled ``U.S. Research Lab Lets Livestock Suffer in Quest for Profit'' about MARC in Clay Center, Nebraska.    The Committee understands that some specific instances mentioned in the article may have been taken out of context and that others may have been exaggerated. It also believes that ARS scientists sincerely care about the animals they work with. The Committee recognizes the need for and value of animal research, but it demands that all animals be treated humanely and that the risk of premature death will be limited wherever possible. No type of abuse or mistreatment will be tolerated.    Aerial Application Research.--The Committee recognizes the importance of the ARS Aerial Application Technology Program. The program conducts innovative research making aerial applications more efficient, effective, and precise. Research for aerial application serves the public good as a vital tool for the future, as agriculture strives to meet the food, fiber, and bio-energy demands of a growing population.    Alfalfa Research.--The Committee supports research into alfalfa seed and forage systems, which hold the potential to maximize crop yields, increase milk production, and improve genetics.    ARS Field Stations.--The Committee recognizes the successful utilization of authorities granted in previous annual appropriations Acts to further cooperation between industry and the ARS Canal Point, Florida Sugarcane Field Station. However, the Committee is concerned that this partnership is jeopardized by requirements that are outside the scope of the functionality of the facilities. The Committee directs ARS to resolve these issues, thus allowing this model partnership to continue. Additionally, the Committee recognizes Florida's importance as a sentinel state in studying invasive pests and diseases. With new species entering ports every week, it is critical that ARS devote attention to the need for research facilities to study these threats.    Aquaculture Industry Coordination.--Nearly half the seafood consumed across the world is the product of aquaculture, and the aquaculture industry is a critical and growing part of the U.S. economy. However, less than one percent of worldwide production comes from U.S. producers. In January , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Services issued a final rule to open the federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico to development of aquaculture. The Committee is concerned that vital seedstock required to implement this initiative will be sourced from foreign aquaculture producers. The Committee encourages the agency to support and protect the U.S. aquaculture industry by working collaboratively with U.S. aquaculture producers and research institutions that specialize in the development of aquaculture technologies.    Aquatic Animal Health.--The Committee supports ARS' work with land-grant universities and other federal partners to develop solutions to aquatic animal pathogens including Aeromonas in catfish and viral hemorrhagic septicemia in finfish. ARS is encouraged to collaborate with industry stakeholders on the development of potential vaccines and therapeutants.    Citrus Greening Disease Research.--The Committee commends ARS' research efforts on citrus greening disease and encourages the agency to continue working to develop methods to reduce transmission and enhance immunity in citrus trees and to work with industry, universities, growers, and other partners to develop effective control mechanisms. The Committee also encourages ARS to coordinate its efforts with the Huanglongbing Multi-Agency Coordination (HLB MAC) group.

Oriental Fruit Fly.--The Committee strongly urges FSA to make funds available to those farmers who were negatively impacted by an Oriental Fruit Fly quarantine from October  through February . The farmers, who were unable to bring their crop to market, sustained devastating losses, although the quarantine was necessary and successful in eradicating the Oriental Fruit Fly pest. Because crop insurance and other similar programs do not apply in instances of a state or federally declared quarantine, the impacted farmers are in need of relief. The Committee believes it is within FSA's purview to make funds available to the impacted farmers.    FSA Farm Loan Levels.--The Committee does not agree with FSA's proposal to waive loan fees for certain groups of farmers. However, the Committee does recognize increased demand for overall loan levels and provides this relief in accordance with the President's budget request, including additional funding for Emergency Loans. In general, USDA data demonstrates that farmers are experiencing a significant decline in farm income and the cost of doing business is growing. As such, the need for larger individual loan limitations and flexibility may be increasing. The Department is directed to work with stakeholders to address these issues.    Budgetary Reductions.--FSA has submitted consecutive proposals for significant annual budget savings through ``operational efficiencies'' with little detail for achieving these goals. FSA proposed nearly  in reductions for fiscal year . An additional  in IT savings is proposed for fiscal year  through contractual savings. The Committee directs FSA to provide a report by the end of fiscal year  detailing the specific contracts and amounts FSA proposes to achieve these savings from.    Proposal to Close County Offices.--The Committee includes statutory language preventing the closure of county offices.    FSA IT.--The agreement includes statutory language that allows FSA to release funds for farm program delivery IT projects only after the submission of a spending plan to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate. The roadmap submitted by FSA in fiscal year  and submission of a spend plan for review to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in fiscal year  were the first steps toward bringing accountability and guidance to almost a decade of mismanagement of the Modernize and Innovate the Delivery of Agricultural Systems (MIDAS) IT system. MIDAS was over budget by hundreds of millions of dollars, took years longer than expected, and only delivered a fraction of the promised results. While FSA has made some improvements in reforming the program, the Committee further directs the agency to provide a report within  days of enactment of this Act on its future plans for MIDAS-specific IT functions.    Loan Deficiency Payments.--The Committee encourages the Secretary to work with producers who have already received a benefit under  U.S.C.  with respect to the  crop of a commodity prior to the availability of a benefit under  U.S.C.  as provided by amendments made by Public Law -.    Alternative Imaging Capabilities.--The Committee notes that space-based infrared and hyper-spectral satellites are ideally suited to managing and monitoring agricultural lands and waters. These commercially-available capabilities could do much toward more efficient use of agriculture resources. Accordingly, the Committee encourages the Department to examine the utility and cost of new, commercially-derived, space-based imaging data systems that can support the agriculture community, including ways that improve efficiencies within the Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services mission area.    Economic Impact of Livestock and Conservation Reserve Program (CRP).--CRP is a federal program under FSA that pays a yearly rental payment in exchange for farmers and ranchers to remove environmentally sensitive land from agricultural production. Due to increasing enrollment in CRP in certain areas, livestock operations have been reduced. In an effort to focus on the economic impact of CRP in rural communities, specifically livestock production, the Committee directs FSA to submit a report within  days of enactment of this Act. Central facets of the report should focus on () the opportunities livestock production brings to rural communities; () determine the economic impact livestock production has on rural communities (feed sales, construction/fencing costs, management practice investments that increase revenue for local businesses); () explore the tax benefits for rural school districts resulting from property taxes and cash receipts due to livestock production; and () assess the ability for nutrients to be captured and soil quality maintained by grazing livestock (similar to the CRP program)."

Section  Intermediary Pilot Program.--The bill directs the Secretary to continue and expand the pilot program for packaging section  direct loans. The pilot requires not less than ten non-profit organizations to prepare and review applications for single family loans, saving federal funds and staff time. The Committee expects the Rural Housing Service to expeditiously implement this program.    Section  Loan Program.--The Farm Labor Housing program (Section ) has been successful in assisting in the development of farm housing. The program presently only permits housing of certain farm workers and has not taken into consideration changes in the agricultural labor market. As a result, farmers are restricted on who can use the housing built with these funds to house the workers they need to prune and harvest their crops. USDA is directed to report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate within  days of enactment of this Act regarding the feasibility and impacts of amending the program to expand the list of eligible tenants permitted to live in existing housing.    Rural Definition.--Communities need transparency and deserve to understand the criteria that are evaluated when determining eligibility for RHS programs. The Committee directs RHS to submit a report listing the criteria used to define ``rural in character'' in determining program eligibility.    The following table reflects the loan levels for the Rural Housing Insurance Fund program account:"

The Committee encourages the Rural Business-Cooperative Service to award funds on a first-come first-serve basis, after taking all other eligibility requirements into account, and not the prioritization system utilized in fiscal year . The Committee supports utilizing a first-come first-serve award system as the most expeditious means to award funds to eligible projects."

641,114-531 H.txt,    For the Rural Water and Waste Disposal Program Account,"    For the Rural Water and Waste Disposal Program Account, the Committee provides an appropriation of .    Water Supplies for Very Small Communities.--The Committee is aware of concerns that Rural Utilities Service (RUS) grant programs do not adequately help small, disadvantaged, and severely disadvantaged communities access the funding and expertise necessary to develop sustainable water supplies or otherwise improve their wastewater systems, and it directs the agency to focus its efforts to assist these communities with predevelopment planning to help them address their water supply needs.    Carryover Balances for AK, HI, and Colonias Grants.--The Committee is aware of significant carryover balances of unobligated funds provided in prior year appropriations for Water and Waste Disposal grants for Alaskan villages, Native American Tribes, Hawaiian Homelands, and the Colonias. The Committee urges the Department to work with state, local and tribal organization stakeholders to provide assistance via water and waste disposal grant programs as long as such assistance was requested by the respective groups in the year in which the funds were appropriated. The Department has flexibility to shift these prior year funds among the four areas through a reprogramming of funds. Further, the Committee provides flexibility in fiscal year  to move funds to other water and waste disposal priorities in order to reduce the backlog of related needs nationwide.    Open and Free Competition Policy.--The Committee supports the Department's underlying adherence to free and open competition on water and waste projects as contained in  CFR .(b) and (d). The Committee supports efforts to eliminate arbitrary actions in the procurement process but is concerned that the Department is undermining the ability of local communities and the engineer of record to design water and wastewater projects in the manner that best serves the unique needs and considerations of local communities. In particular, the Committee is concerned about the May ,  memorandum and the implementation of pipe materials. The Committee believes that the Department must apply its policy uniformly to all building materials but is concerned with the Department requirements that would unnecessarily delay projects by including onerous approval processes. Communities and professional engineers are different and specify the pipe materials that best suit the needs of their community and project. These communities and engineers, therefore make different determinations depending on what is suited for a given community, including the existence of applicable federal, state, or local ordinances or standard specifications. The Committee encourages the Department to defer to the engineer of record in the selection of materials that meet nationally recognized standards, including pipe, absent extraordinary circumstances demonstrating arbitrary action.    Domestic Preference.--The bill includes language specifying that funds made available for RUS' Rural Water and Waste Disposal program account shall use iron and steel products produced in the United States. RUS shall apply the Environmental Protection Agency's definition of public water systems while implementing the domestic preference provision.    The following table provides the Committee's recommendations as compared to the budget request:"

Broadband Loan and Grant Program Priorities.--The Committee recognizes the advantages of extending broadband services, including the economic development opportunities and improved health care services that broadband technology provides. Funding provided for the broadband programs is intended to promote availability in those areas where there is not otherwise a business case for private investment in a broadband network. The Committee directs RUS to focus expenditures on projects that bring broadband service to underserved households and areas.    Tribal Communities.--The Committee notes that tribal communities continue to struggle with gaining access to broadband service. The Committee encourages the Secretary to provide a report that identifies the specific challenges Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs) have in gaining access to broadband service and provide a plan for addressing these challenges, including how the Community Connect program can assist ITOs."

Communication from FNS.--The Committee recognizes the efforts made to increase communication and reduce delays by FNS in completing requested reports. Reports requested by the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate, as well as information regarding FNS programs, are an important part of the Committees' oversight responsibilities. The directives and issues that are specified in the House, Senate, or conference report are very important to the Committee and the dates specified are mandatory. FNS is expected to keep the Committee apprised of activities and issues, especially those mentioned in Committee reports. FNS is reminded that the Committee reserves the right to call before it any agency that does not submit reports on time.    Public Release of Information.--The Committee directs FNS to continue making all policy documents related to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program (including, but not limited to, instructions, memoranda, guidance, and questions and answers) available to the public on the Internet within one week of their release to WIC state administrators.    Program Eligibility.--The Committee directs FNS to work with states to ensure full compliance with the law mandating that every WIC and SNAP participant meet all program eligibility requirements. FNS is also directed to ensure these programs are not being promoted to ineligible individuals, which would increase program costs.    Fruit and Vegetable Consumption.--The Committee continues to urge FNS to recognize in relevant agency publications and regulations related to all federal nutrition programs, including nutrition education programs and child nutrition programs, the nutritional benefits provided by all forms of fruits, vegetables, and beans, whether canned, dried, fresh, or frozen."
645,114-531 H.txt,    For the Child Nutrition Programs,"    For the Child Nutrition Programs, the Committee provides .    School Meals.--The Committee remains concerned about the challenges and costs that local schools face in implementing the various regulations from the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of . Some schools are continuing to have difficulty complying with the whole grain requirements that went into effect on July , , and schools are increasingly concerned with further reductions in the sodium requirements. In order to provide schools with the certainty and flexibility they need for the - school year, the Committee continues to extend the whole grain waiver provision to those school food authorities demonstrating a hardship in implementing the whole grain standards.    The Committee also continues a provision stating that sodium standards cannot be reduced below Target  until the latest scientific research establishes that the reduction is beneficial for children. According to information provided by USDA, the overwhelming majority of research that has been reviewed on this issue was conducted more than  years ago, with most research conducted in the s and s. The Committee notes that the requirement that the latest scientific research prove that further sodium reductions are beneficial for children has not been met.    As schools seek to implement the school meal standards, the Committee encourages USDA to consider ways to assist schools with technical assistance and training, including the services of not-for-profit culinary institutions, to provide healthy, cost-effective foods that students will eat.    Improper Payments.--The Committee remains concerned about the staggering error rates for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP), which were about  percent and  percent, respectively, in fiscal year . This amounts to  in improper payments for NSLP and  for SBP. While the error rate for SBP had a small decrease, there was a slight increase in the error rate for NSLP. OIG completed an audit report in May of  that evaluated how FNS is attempting to lower the error rates, and the Committee acknowledges FNS is working to address this issue. The fiscal year  explanatory statement directed FNS to provide a report addressing OIG's recommendations. The Committee expects this report by June , .    Potable Water.--The Committee is aware of the statutory requirement that schools and child care centers make potable water available to children free of charge during meal times in the place where meals are served. The Committee directs USDA to provide a report on the actions that have been taken to ensure that potable water is being provided in schools and child care centers.    Technology Use in School Meal Programs.--The Committee supports increased use of technology as a strategy to combat waste, fraud and abuse in the school meal programs and urges USDA to continue to allow local control in the selection of technology platforms. The Committee directs USDA to clearly communicate to recipients of any funding that can be used for technology infrastructure in or for the support of school meal programs that the funds are intended to establish state systems that are capable of interoperability or interface with the technology platforms selected by school districts.    The following table reflects the Committee recommendations for the child nutrition programs:"
646,114-531 H.txt,    For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,"    For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, the Committee provides an appropriation of . The Committee provides for continuation of the breastfeeding peer counselor program and infrastructure.    USDA data shows that WIC participation rates have decreased steadily since fiscal year . The President's budget request includes a projection of an average monthly participation rate of . million women, infants, and children for fiscal year . However, the average monthly participation rate was . million for fiscal year , and the current average for fiscal year  is . million. Birth rates also remain at an all-time low according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).    USDA is estimating recovery and carryover funds to be much higher than average at more than . Furthermore, the Secretary has a sufficient WIC contingency reserve fund as a safety net to meet unexpected demand. With lower participation rates, higher carryover funds, and an ample reserve fund, the Committee provides funding that will ensure all eligible participants will be served. The Committee will continue to monitor WIC participation, carryover funds, and food costs and take additional action as necessary to ensure that funding provided in fiscal year  remains sufficient to serve all eligible applicants.    Income Eligibility Standards.--The Committee continues to monitor WIC income eligibility standards to ensure all procedures are followed by the WIC state and local agencies. FNS has been conducting Certification and Eligibility Management Evaluations on all state agencies and ITOs in order to ensure compliance and maintain program integrity in the participant certification process. USDA is directed to provide a report describing the results of these evaluations, detailing discrepancies found in determining participant eligibility and the certification process. The report should include steps FNS will take to ensure state agencies and ITOs adhere to the income verification procedures that the Department has implemented.    Program Integrity and Fraudulent Activities.--The FNS WIC Program Integrity and Monitoring Branch plays a role in helping WIC state agencies address vendor management, cost containment, and fraudulent activities such as the online sale of WIC-provided infant formula. The Committee remains concerned about fraud and abuse in the program and directs FNS to provide a report on this branch's efforts and results in addressing these areas.    WIC Eligibility of Multivitamins.--The Committee encourages FNS to prepare a report assessing the inclusion of vitamins eligible for purchase as part of the supplemental foods under the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children (WIC). Such report shall include: whether there are dietary deficiencies within the WIC population that could be enhanced through such inclusion; considerations regarding the implementation and possible health impacts of such inclusion; cost considerations related to such inclusion. This report shall be submitted to the Committee not later than  days after enactment of this Act.    Zika Outreach and Education.--The Committee is supportive of ensuring pregnant women are educated on the various methods for preventing exposure to the Zika virus during pregnancy. The Committee directs the Department, in consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to continue its education and outreach efforts through the WIC program to provide pregnant women with the information they need to prevent Zika. During fiscal year , the Department is directed to designate  to assist with Zika outreach and education, with priority given to States with the greatest need."
647,114-531 H.txt,    For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,"    For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Committee provides . The total amount includes  for a contingency reserve to be used only in the amount necessary. Section  provides an additional  for the purchase of TEFAP commodities in order to maintain the fiscal year  funding level.    The Committee provides an increase of  for Nutrition Education and Program Information solely for SNAP Employment and Training technical assistance. The Committee is aware of coordinated attempts to circumvent the directive in the fiscal year  explanatory statement in order to provide funding for existing Centers of Excellence. Therefore, consistent with the Consolidated Appropriations Act of , the Committee does not provide funding for new or existing Centers of Excellence, which have not been authorized by Congress.    Required Reporting for Out-of-State Moves.--The Committee remains committed to eliminating fraud and abuse within SNAP. Bill language is included to require SNAP participants to report to the state agency when they move outside of the state in which they are certified. This provision closes a loophole in order to prevent fraudulent SNAP participation in multiple states.    SNAP Purchase Report.--The Committee is aware that FNS is preparing a report describing purchases made by SNAP recipients as compared to non-SNAP recipients. FNS is directed to complete this report as soon as practicable and make this report publicly available.    SNAP Error Rates.--An OIG report issued in September of  reviewed the FNS quality control process for determining the SNAP error rate associated with benefits provided to recipients. OIG found vulnerabilities and inconsistencies in the methods used to determine the error rate and concluded FNS' quality control process resulted in an understatement of SNAP's error rates. The fiscal year  explanatory statement directed the Department to provide a report on how FNS will address OIG's recommendations. The Committee expects this report no later than June , .    Recruitment Activities.--The Committee continues to direct USDA to ensure that Section  of the  farm bill is implemented and enforced in a manner consistent with the statute which prohibits USDA from conducting recruitment activities, advertising the program, or entering into agreements with foreign governments to promote SNAP benefits. The Committee continues to direct USDA to enforce this provision to ensure that state agencies are not reimbursed for such activities consistent with the statute.    Issuance of SNAP Benefits.--The Committee notes that some states issue SNAP benefits to recipients in a compressed time frame, usually at the beginning of the month, which causes challenges for both SNAP participants and retailers. The Committee continues to direct FNS to work with those states with a compressed issuance schedule to provide benefits at least twice per month and to report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate progress made on this issue.    Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Equipment.--The Committee is aware that some farmers markets and farmers selling directly to consumers are interested in EBT equipment that operates for a variety of federal nutrition programs. FNS is encouraged to assist farmers markets and direct-selling farmers in obtaining EBT equipment that allows participation in other federal nutrition programs.    The following table reflects the Committee recommendations for SNAP:"

TEFAP Handling and Distribution Costs.--In addition to grant funds supporting commodity handling and distribution costs, the bill permits states to use up to  percent of the funds provided for purchasing TEFAP commodities to help with the costs of storing, transporting, and distributing commodities. The Committee expects state agencies to consult with their emergency feeding organizations on the need for the conversion of such funds."

This should be specifically targeted to increase U.S. exports and remove existing trade barriers.    Farmer-to-Farmer.--The Farmer-to-Farmer program provides valuable outreach opportunities for U.S. agricultural exports. The program enhances agricultural efforts overseas and strengthens international ties. USDA should take a lead role in promoting and administering the program.

652,114-531 H.txt,    For Food for Peace Title II grants,"    For Food for Peace Title II grants, the Committee provides  of which  is for non-emergency assistance. This is  above the President's request and includes statutory language that requires the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to meet the level for non-emergency assistance using the funds appropriated for the Food for Peace Act (FFPA).    Food Aid Funding and Reform.--The Committee provides  in funding above the President's budget request level. The Committee is concerned that U.S. commodity purchases and maritime sealift capabilities have been significantly reduced due to reforms and circumvention of the spirit of the FFPA. This lack of participation by key stakeholder and constituency groups has resulted in decreased demand and support for the Title II program as reflected in the levels proposed in the President's budget request for the past two years, the most recent of which is  below the fiscal year  enacted level.    In fiscal year , approximately  percent, or  was spent on local and regional purchases, vouchers, cash and other delivery methods under reforms enacted in the  farm bill and the Community Development Fund (CDF). These reforms have reduced the amount of U.S commodities since fiscal year  from  percent to  percent of the program, while Internal Transportation, Storage, and Handling (ITSH) costs have increased by a similar amount.    The Committee is concerned that no data has shown that the enactment of these reforms has produced increased feeding of beneficiaries and quicker food aid delivery as promised. These reforms have only resulted in decreased support and proposed funding for the program. USAID's IG audit report ----P examined  in cash and voucher transfers under the Office of Food for Peace. The report found that ``None of the implementers completed distributions on time, the average delay being  months.'' In addition, one implementer predicted being able to feed , beneficiaries, but  months past the target date, had only reached approximately ,. This data is disturbing and significantly undermines the claims of benefits that would be achieved through the farm bill reforms and further changes proposed by the President's budget.    Nonemergency Assistance.--In a recent legal opinion, GAO determined that ``USAID only obligated . million of the appropriation for nonemergency food assistance'' out of the  million required by the FFPA. While the Committee acknowledges that USAID was able to waive this level legally through ``notwithstanding'' authority in the FFPA for emergency funding purposes, the  farm bill excluded the authority for USAID to waive the level for nonemergency assistance. Therefore, the Committee does not include the new bill language requested by USAID to credit funding from the CDF to the FFPA for nonemergency assistance. Instead, the Committee includes statutory language requiring USAID to meet the nonemergency assistance level for FY  as intended by Congress. The Committee notes that USAID has access to the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust (BEHT) for emergency purposes, for which the Committee provided additional funding in FY . USAID requested use of emergency funds from the BEHT as recently as  when USDA released  million from the BEHT to procure an estimated , metric tons of commodities, and this action was further supported by an additional  million from USDA's CCC for associated costs, including transportation and distribution.    CCC Financial Statements.--The Committee directs the Department and USAID to address issues arising from deficiencies identified in USDA's delayed financial statements and the parent-child relationship between USDA and USAID. The Committee further directs both agencies to continue to update and ratify a written agreement that clearly defines roles and responsibilities for carrying out the Food for Peace Title II program.    ITSH Costs.--The Committee directs the Department and USAID to provide a clear definition of these costs, how they are incurred, and how they differ from Inland Freight Costs. The Committee is concerned that these costs have increased significantly in recent years and seeks to understand the causes. The Committee also directs USAID to identify whether local and regional purchases, cash, and vouchers are counted as a part of these costs. USAID is directed to provide this information within  days of enactment of this Act.    Central American Food Assistance.--The Administrator of USAID is directed to provide a report within  days of enactment of this Act on the amounts and types of food aid to Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.

The bill includes language to permit the Commission to sublease its excess space for cost savings and allow the Commission to correct leasing payments and potential violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act.    GAO Review of Leasing Costs.--The Committee requested a review of GAO's leasing costs following the CFTC's IG review, which found approximately  in savings over the life of the Commission's leases. GAO's review found that: () if CFTC had received its full budget request in recent years, it could have staffed , Full Time Equivalents (FTEs) versus a capacity of , FTEs; () CFTC's actual occupancy rate of FTE ranges from  percent to  percent; and ()  percent of CFTC's claimed occupancy rate is fulfilled by on-site contractors that have increased by  percent from fiscal year  to fiscal year . The Committee's inclusion of authority to sublease space will allow the agency to find cost-savings through increasing occupancy rates of leased space. The Committee also encourages the Commission to have its on-site contractors bear the cost of office space through renegotiation of current contracts.    Collective Bargaining Agreement Reductions.--The Committee notes that the Commission's level of FTEs has been reduced from a projection of  in fiscal year  to an actual level of . These reductions are the result of a self-imposed collective bargaining agreement that has limited the Commission's ability to increase staffing levels."

The Committee recommendation includes the following offices under the Office of the Secretary: Office of the Secretary; Office of Tribal Relations; Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Coordination; Office of Advocacy and Outreach; Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration; Departmental Administration; Office of the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations; and Office of Communications.    Pay Cost.--The Committee does not include requested funding for a civilian pay increase across the Department.    Improper Payments.--The Office of the Inspector General recently reported that USDA's agencies and offices have made progress toward improving their processes to identify, report, and reduce improper payments. However, USDA estimated it made  in improper payments in fiscal year . The Committee finds this unacceptable and strongly encourages the Secretary to make a concerted effort to significantly reduce USDA's improper payments in fiscal year .    CCC Report.--The Committee directs the Secretary to provide a report on November , , and May , , on planned uses of funding under the authorities of Section  and Section  of the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act.    Notification.--Within  days from the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall notify the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the allocation of the funds provided to the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations by USDA agency, along with an explanation for the agency-by-agency distribution of the funds.    State Office Collocation.--The Committee continues to direct that any reallocation of resources related to the collocation of state offices scheduled for fiscal year  and subsequent years is subject to the Committee's reprogramming procedures required under law.    Administrative Provision.--The Committee directs the Secretary to advise the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress, through the Office of Budget and Program Analysis, of the status of all reports requested of the Department in this bill at the time of submission of the fiscal year  budget and monthly thereafter. The Committee reminds the Secretary that all correspondence related to the directives in this bill must be addressed to the Committee on Appropriations.    Loan and Grant Programs.--The Committee directs the Department, through the Office of Budget and Program Analysis, to provide quarterly reports to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate on the status of obligations and funds availability for the loan and grant programs provided in this bill.    The Committee further directs that if an estimate of loan activity for any program funded in Titles I and III of this bill indicates that a limitation on authority to make commitments for a fiscal year will be reached before the end of that fiscal year, or in any event whenever  percent of the authority to make commitments has been utilized, the Secretary shall promptly notify the Committees in writing, through the Office of Budget and Program Analysis.    Need for Better Communication from USDA.--As part of the Committee's oversight responsibilities, the Members of the Committee must be informed of the activities, pending and proposed actions, and expenditures made by USDA and its respective agencies so that Congress can determine whether laws and programs are being implemented and carried out in accordance with the intent of Congress. The Committee should not have to require reports and briefings to receive information and data pertinent to its jurisdiction. In addition to the reporting and approval requirements stated in this report and accompanying bill, the Department is advised to increase both the timing and frequency of communication on major policy and spending activities so that Congress may conduct its oversight responsibilities as expected by U.S. taxpayers.    GSA Rent and DHS Security Expenses.--In accordance with the Committee's statement in H. Rpt. -, as well as the shift of expenses within the fiscal year  budget proposal, the funding levels in this bill reflect the estimated costs included in the budget request so that agencies will now begin to manage and pay their own respective rent and security expenses. The Committee reiterates its continued concern for the increasing costs of rent and related operations, especially at a time when staffing levels are decreasing and such costs limit an agency's ability to apply limited resources to the highest priorities and core responsibilities. Any future requests for increases to rent and security costs will need to be accompanied by detailed justifications.    Emerging Livestock Diseases.--The Committee is concerned about the growing incidence of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and swine delta coronavirus and strongly encourages USDA to utilize its research, extension, and animal health resources in partnership with pork producers, related industries, and land-grant universities to quickly develop and deploy effective control and management tools.    Food Safety Collaboration at USDA.--The Committee is pleased with USDA's recent announcement in May  of a collaborative effort between the Food Safety and Inspection Service and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to provide a more comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to address foodborne health hazards potentially associated with meat and poultry products. The collaborative effort represents progress towards improving communications and sharing of information between the agencies to uncover root causes of foodborne illnesses and the practices that can mitigate food safety issues. The Committee commends USDA for taking such actions and directs USDA to keep the Committee apprised of the results of the collaborative efforts in addressing food safety.    Design-Build.--The Committee encourages the Department to use the design-build method of project delivery when appropriate.    Invasive Species.--The Committee recognizes the threats posed by invasive plant species and the need to protect, restore, and enhance native plants, including those that are endangered or threatened. The Committee encourages the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to support the research, education, and conservation of native plants.

The Committee notes that the Agricultural Act of  provides mandatory funding for the Specialty Crop Block Grant program and the Organic Production and Market Data Initiative.    Mandatory Country of Origin Labeling (COOL).--The Committee is aware that the governments of Canada and Mexico have challenged a final rule published in the Federal Register on May , , ( Fed. Reg. ) claiming that it violates the United States' international trade obligations in cases WT/DS and WT/DS, which are pending before a compliance panel of the World Trade Organization (WTO). It is estimated that U.S. exports to the two countries will suffer an economic impact of approximately  in retaliatory actions should the final adjudication of this matter by the WTO determine the COOL requirements are inconsistent with U.S. international trade obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade annexed to the WTO agreement, the WTO agreement, or the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade referred to in section (d)() of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act ( U.S.C. (d)()). Additionally, the USDA Chief Economist noted at a House Agriculture Committee hearing on April , , that USDA has found that COOL has little impact on consumer meat choices based on survey data.

The Committee is concerned about waste, fraud, and abuse in programs administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the Risk Management Agency (RMA). Therefore, the Secretary is directed to certify that any newly approved payment, loan, grant, subsidy, or insurance claim from a program administered by FSA or RMA does not include individuals or entities that have been permanently debarred from participating in USDA programs.    Farm Bill Implementation.--The Committee is aware that the Agricultural Act of  provided  in mandatory funds for FSA to implement title I of the Act. The Committee directs the Secretary to provide a detailed plan by October , , on how this funding will be utilized. At a minimum, the plan should include information on any interagency agreements or contracts with the private sector and other non-Federal entities; the purpose, amounts, and dates of estimated obligations; and the number of part-time, temporary, or related staff hired to assist with implementation. On October , , and every quarter thereafter until the funds are expended, the Committee directs the Secretary to provide a status report on the obligations and outlays and expects that the Committee will be notified if there are any significant deviations from the plan. The Committee reminds the Secretary that funding is not available to hire new full-time equivalent staff at FSA. As such, this funding should not be used for that purpose."

FSA Budget Request.--The Committee does not support the proposals in the budget submission that include significant funding shifts with no justification and basis to support them. The Committee is displeased with the agency's budget request as there is no rationale for the proposed changes. The request proposed a reduction in costly headquarters and state office staff personnel while shifting the costs to hire the same number of personnel in the field while simultaneously decreasing  non-Federal staff years. No clear plan of how these actions would be implemented in a timely manner in order to sustain the significant reductions was provided in the justification, and no evidence of the impact of such actions was offered to the Committee to form a reasonable opinion on the matter. The Committee would like to remind the agency that submitting such budget requests is a waste of taxpayer resources. The Committee encourages the agency to develop more meaningful budget requests in the future. The Committee supports more efficient policies, practices, and operations in the delivery of farm programs across the country, but it will require the appropriate supporting data and documentation to form a corresponding decision.    Proposal to Close County Offices.--The President's fiscal year  budget proposed to close or consolidate an estimated  FSA county offices and reduce the non-federal staff years by roughly  full time equivalents as part of an effort to modernize the Department's farm program delivery system. The Committee supports greater efficiency in the management of limited Federal tax dollars and supports the consolidation of locations or activities when there is a strong case for such a proposal. However, the President's budget proposal is both flawed and untimely. Department officials have shown great difficulty in explaining the justification for this proposal when questioned by this Committee and other oversight committees. Secondly, in order to maintain quality service within a reasonable timeframe, the Department should have the requisite infrastructure and support in place before moving offices into a ``model service center'' location. The Department has failed to demonstrate that the information technology systems are mature enough to support this concept. Thirdly, preparing for a consolidation of offices while county employees continue implementation of the  farm bill is ill-timed. Lastly, the ability to deliver farm programs to stakeholders is contingent upon an analysis on the needs of a particular county office or offices within a particular region. Therefore, in addition to the requirements mandated by the  farm bill for office closures, the Department is directed to conduct, complete, and submit an evaluation of workload assessments for proposed office closures to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate prior to the closure of any FSA county offices.    MIDAS.--The Committee has strong concerns regarding the delays and potential cost overruns associated with the Modernize and Innovate the Delivery of Agricultural Systems (MIDAS) program. As designed, the system is supposed to improve the delivery of FSA farm program benefits and services through re-engineered business processes and the adoption of enhanced and modernized information technology. While FSA made some initial progress in  with the release of the Farm Records and Business Partner functionality, little progress is evident or expected for fiscal year . Over a year ago, FSA notified the Committee that the agency was in the process of reviewing the timeline for the next phases and future rollouts of the project via a re-baseline process. The purpose of the re-baseline project was to align the project scope with the most recent schedule and projected available funding. Congress has appropriated nearly  to support the modernization of a farm program delivery system. The total lifecycle costs of this program continue to grow beyond the initial estimates and will continue to grow if the Department fails to manage this project in a far more efficient manner. FSA must continue to proceed with plans for the original functionality that would build existing farm program applications into an integrated system that delivers increased efficiency and security and not continue down a path of siloed applications that fail to improve upon the capabilities originally promised to the Nation's farmers and ranchers. The Committee directs USDA to provide quarterly briefings in writing and in person to both the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations starting on October , ."

The Committee is pleased with the results of CEAP and the agency's efforts to modernize the delivery of conservation programs and services through CDSI and encourages the continuation of these efforts.    Agricultural Conservation Easement Program.--Due to the unique ecological needs of each State, the Committee encourages NRCS to work with state and local partners to address these needs and to ensure the priority needs and projects in each State, such as those that are leveraged by public and private resources, are addressed, as appropriate.    Cheat Grass Eradication.--The Committee encourages NRCS to continue to assist farmers and ranchers to eradicate, control, and reduce the fuel loads associated with cheat grass and to collaborate with ARS, as appropriate, on research related to cheat grass.    Conservation Practice Standards.--The Committee is aware that NRCS has been pressured to modify its conservation practice standards in certain circumstances for purposes not related to the conservation of farm and ranch land. The Committee recognizes that conservation practice standards are science-based, undergo a thorough technical review, are open to the public for notice and comment, and reflect the best available knowledge on how to achieve the identified conservation and environmental objective. The Committee directs NRCS to maintain its long-standing process for developing and updating its conservation practice standards.    Herbicide Resistance.--The Committee reminds NRCS of the challenges many producers are facing due to the spread of herbicide-resistant weeds and encourages it to ensure agency staff, partners, and producers are aware of conservation practice standards and conservation activity plans to address herbicide-resistant weeds, and that financial assistance through certain conservation programs is available to assist producers in their efforts to control these weeds.    Locally Led Conservation.--The Committee recognizes that locally led conservation is the foundation of the Nation's highly successful legacy of conservation and encourages NRCS to work with State, Tribal, local, and other partners on voluntary stewardship projects that preserve working agricultural lands while protecting watersheds and wildlife habitat.    National Marine Sanctuaries.--The Committee urges the agency to continue the collaborative agreement with the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries to address agricultural sources of runoff, such as sediments, nitrates, and pesticides.    Resource Conservation and Development Councils.--The Committee recognizes RC&Ds have been valuable partners in conservation and encourages NRCS to continue working with local councils, as appropriate, to ensure conservation programs meet local resource needs.    Sage Grouse Initiative.--The Committee supports NRCS's sage grouse conservation efforts. Through the initiative, NRCS provides technical and financial assistance to help landowners conserve sage grouse habitat on their land. The initiative is an integral part of efforts by Federal agencies, several western States, and private landowners to help preclude the listing of the sage grouse as an endangered species.    Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Plan.--The Committee directs NRCS to establish a long-term, multi-year plan to guide needed investments in watershed surveys and planning and watershed operations as authorized under the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act, P.L. -. The plan should establish a process for setting and ranking watershed operations and flood prevention priorities, reflecting the agency's mission, goals, and requirements; consideration of existing investment in planning, infrastructure, and land treatment; and future needs for investment to improve watershed condition or prevent or mitigate watershed impairments. The plan should also include estimated funding requirements. As the agency develops the plan, the Committee encourages it to provide interested parties an opportunity to provide input. The agency is directed to develop the plan and report to Congress within  days after enactment of this Act."

The report should include information on the factors the agency uses to determine whether a community is ``rural in character'' and when a ``serious lack of mortgage credit exists''. The report also should include a history of the agency's actions using this three-part test since the  U.S. Census and its implementation of the changes made by the Agricultural Act of .    Risk Management.--USDA's Rural Development mission area manages about . million loans that have a value of ;  of this is in the rural housing and community facility portfolio. Given the size of the Federal investment in rural housing programs, the Committee believes RHS should actively monitor and manage this portfolio to mitigate risk. As such, the Committee directs RHS to provide a report within  days of enactment of this Act on the risk in its portfolio and how it is managed. The Committee further directs the agency to expeditiously create and fill a position of Chief Risk Officer whose responsibility it will be to manage and mitigate the agency's financial risk.    Section  Intermediary Pilot Program.--The bill directs the Secretary to continue and expand the pilot program for packaging section  direct loans.

The Committee expects USDA to continue implementation of section  of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of  (P.L. -).    The Committee remains concerned about the lack of communication and delay by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) in completing requested reports. Reports requested by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, as well as information regarding FNS programs, are an important part of the Committees' oversight responsibilities. The directives and issues that are specified in the House, Senate, or conference report are very important to the Committee, and dates are mandatory. FNS is expected to keep the Committee apprised of activities and issues, especially those mentioned in Committee reports. FNS is reminded that the Committee reserves the right to call before it any agency that does not submit reports on time.    FNS is directed to provide the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate the FNS Research and Evaluation Plan each fiscal year when this report is available.    The Committee directs FNS to continue making all policy documents related to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program (including, but not limited to, instructions, memoranda, guidance, and questions and answers) available to the public on the Internet within one week of their release to state WIC administrators.    The Committee directs FNS to work with States to ensure full compliance with the law that all WIC and SNAP participants meet all program eligibility requirements. FNS also is directed to ensure these programs are not being promoted to ineligible individuals, which would increase program costs.    The Dietary Guidelines for Americans emphasize that Americans should consume more fruits and vegetables in all of their forms. In order to maximize the value of the benefits nutrition program participants receive, the Committee urges FNS to recognize in relevant agency publications related to all Federal nutrition programs, including nutrition education programs, the nutritional benefits provided by all forms of fruits, vegetables, and beans, whether canned, dried, fresh, or frozen.    Impact of the Affordable Care Act on SNAP and WIC.--The Committee is aware that FNS is examining how the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will impact and possibly increase enrollment for SNAP and WIC. The ACA expands eligibility for Medicaid and it is expected that this will lead to an increase in SNAP and WIC applications. The Committee directs FNS to provide an update, including all white papers and memos, on both of these projects within  days of enactment of this Act. As these projects continue, FNS is directed to keep the Committee apprised of any additional reports and provide the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate with the final results of these studies."
719,113-468 H.txt,    For the Child Nutrition Programs,"    For the Child Nutrition Programs, the Committee provides . Included in this total is  for school meals equipment grants and  for summer electronic benefit transfer (EBT) pilot projects. In carrying out summer EBT projects, the Committee encourages FNS to select populations in both rural and urban areas that have not been piloted.    School Meals.--The Committee is concerned about the challenges and costs that local schools face in implementing the various regulations from the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of . Schools from across the Nation have expressed concern with increased food costs and plate waste coupled with decreased participation in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), all of which is resulting in at least half of all school food authorities to experience a decline in revenue. A February , , GAO report found that student participation in the NSLP declined by . million students from school year - through school year -. Additional meal requirements are scheduled to be implemented in the - school year as well as the ``Smart Snacks in School'' interim final rule.    To address the concerns of local schools, the FY  conference report directed the Secretary to establish a waiver process for schools incurring costs to provide more time to comply with some of these regulations. On March , , the Secretary responded he did not have the statutory authority to grant such waivers. Therefore, the Committee includes bill language that provides schools with flexibility by allowing schools experiencing a financial loss for at least a six-month period to seek a waiver from compliance with the final regulations. The Committee directs USDA to implement this provision in a timely and streamlined manner. Schools receiving a waiver under this provision shall, at a minimum, implement the nutrition standards in effect prior to the final rule issued on January , . The bill language does not provide for a change in reimbursement rates and only applies to the - school year.    As schools seek to implement the school meal standards, the Committee encourages USDA to consider ways to assist schools with technical assistance and training, including the services of not-for-profit culinary institutions, to provide healthy, cost-effective foods that students will eat.    The Committee recognizes the importance of cultural and regional differences in food items served in the NSLP and the School Breakfast Program (SBP). Numerous food products are undergoing reformulation to meet the new nutrition standards. Some that have been developed are not widely available, do not have the proper stability or consistency to be served on school lunch lines, and are not palatable when compared to traditional and regional foods. The Committee encourages FNS to issue guidance within  days of enactment of this Act to school food authorities that provides alternative options in regards to culturally and regionally diverse food products served in the NSLP and SBP.    Furthermore, the Committee is aware of concerns with the requirements in the proposed rule published in the Federal Register on February , , ``Professional Standards for State and Local School Nutrition Programs Personnel.'' The Committee notes that the proposed standards could create economic hardship and adverse effects on workforce capacity issues, which are better addressed by local school districts. The Committee strongly encourages FNS to work with stakeholders to ensure any professional standards do not result in unintended consequences for local schools.    Lastly, the Committee directs USDA to submit a report within  days of enactment of this Act that describes whether or not all of the food sold in all USDA cafeterias and vending machines in the Washington, D.C., National Capital Area meet the same nutrition standards as those required for the NSLP, SBP, and the ``Smart Snack'' rule.    Prioritization of Monitoring and Compliance Reviews.--The Committee directs the Secretary to allow States to vary the frequency of monitoring and compliance reviews of each school food authority based on past school performance, with no cycle extending more than five years as granted in the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of .    Fruit and Vegetable Pilot Program.--The Committee recognizes that Section  of the Agricultural Act of  provided  for the pilot project for canned, frozen, or dried fruits and vegetables, in addition to funds made available for the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. The Committee directs USDA to implement the pilot at the beginning of the - school year so that children in selected schools will have access to all forms of fruits and vegetables for the duration of the school year. This will ensure the full effects of the pilot program can be evaluated in a timely manner to comply with the January , , statutory deadline for an interim report. The Committee encourages the Secretary to select States for participation that are geographically diverse, face barriers to accessing fresh fruits and vegetables, and have a large number of students eligible for free and reduced price meals.    The following table reflects the Committee recommendations for the child nutrition programs:"
720,113-468 H.txt,    For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,"    For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), the Committee provides an appropriation of .    The Committee received a revised estimate from USDA showing that  would serve all eligible participants in fiscal year . The decrease from the President's budget request is based upon several important factors. First, USDA has decreased the estimated average monthly participation rate from . million women, infants, and children to . million. Birth rates continue to be at a record low according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Second, USDA is projecting that more funding will be available through recovery and carryover funds than originally estimated. Furthermore, the Secretary has  in the WIC contingency reserve fund as a safety net to meet unexpected demand. With lower participation rates, higher carryover funds, and a sufficient reserve fund, USDA has revised the estimate to better reflect actual program needs. The Committee will continue to monitor WIC participation, carryover funds, and food costs and take additional action as necessary to ensure that funding provided in fiscal year  is sufficient to serve all eligible applicants.    The Committee provides for continuation of the breastfeeding peer counselor program, infrastructure, and investments in management information systems within the total amount provided in the bill. The Committee also provides  for States to continue transitioning from paper checks and vouchers to an EBT system. EBT is a proven, effective tool in combatting waste, fraud, and abuse, and all WIC state agencies are mandated to have an EBT system in place by October , .    Income Eligibility Standards.--The Committee recognizes that in response to the February  GAO report, ``WIC Program: Improved Oversight of Income Eligibility Determination Needed,'' USDA issued income eligibility guidance to all state agencies in April . The Committee directs USDA to submit a report within  days of enactment of this Act on the policies, procedures, training, and technical assistance it has provided to state WIC agencies on income eligibility determination and verification. The report shall include information on the extent to which all state WIC agencies have complied with the use of a standard set of income eligibility and verification criteria.    Cost Management within WIC State Agencies.--The Committee supports USDA's efforts to rein in the cost of WIC food items while ensuring nutritional value and food choices for participants. As state agencies consider options for cost containment, the Committee directs FNS to closely monitor this process to ensure there are no unintended consequences for participants, vendors, or product manufacturers.    Fraudulent Activities.--The Committee is aware that some individuals are selling WIC benefits or WIC-purchased infant formula or food items on social media sites and by other means, which is a violation of Federal WIC regulations. The Committee notes FNS issued a policy memo in February  describing these fraudulent activities as a program violation. The Committee directs FNS to provide a report within  days of enactment of this Act describing how this policy is enforced and how many state agencies have issued claims and sanctions against participants for committing these activities.    Eligible Foods.--The Committee includes bill language to ensure that all varieties of fresh, whole, or cut vegetables, except for vegetables with added sugars, fats, or oils are eligible for purchase through the WIC program."
721,113-468 H.txt,    For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),"    For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Committee provides . The total amount includes  for a contingency reserve to be used only in the amount necessary.    Fraud, Waste, and Abuse.--The Committee has repeatedly directed USDA to permanently debar retailers and participants from the program if found guilty of fraud and abuse. However, a July  OIG audit report identified  store owners that were allowed to continue participating in SNAP at other locations after being permanently disqualified. These ineligible store owners redeemed millions of dollars in SNAP benefits. The Committee directs FNS to enforce the regulations to ensure ineligible retailers and participants will be permanently disqualified from the program and directs FNS to report within  days of enactment of this Act on how the agency has addressed the deficiencies found by the OIG audit.    The Committee directs FNS to report within  days of enactment of this Act on the compliance of state agencies in the use of the National Directory of New Hires and an immigration verification system as required by the Agricultural Act of . The Committee notes additional funding has been provided for FNS to fight trafficking and fraud and directs FNS to keep the Committee apprised as fraud prevention provisions are implemented.    Recruitment Activities.--The Committee directs USDA to ensure Section  of the Agricultural Act of  is implemented and enforced in a manner consistent with the statute which prohibits USDA from conducting recruitment activities, advertising the program, and from entering into agreements with foreign governments to promote SNAP benefits. The Committee directs USDA to enforce this provision to ensure state agencies are not reimbursed for similar activities consistent with the statute.    Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.--The Committee is aware of the interest in transitioning the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands into SNAP. The FY  House report, as well as the Agricultural Act of , directed the Secretary to conduct a feasibility study on establishing a SNAP program in the Northern Mariana Islands. The Committee expects USDA to complete this study in accordance with the statutory deadlines established in the Agricultural Act of .    The following table reflects the Committee recommendations for SNAP:"

TEFAP Handling and Distribution Costs.--In addition to the grant funds to support commodity handling and distribution costs, the bill permits States to use up to  percent of the funds provided for purchasing TEFAP commodities to help with the costs of storing, transporting, and distributing commodities. The Committee expects state agencies to consult with their emergency feeding organizations on the need for the conversion of such funds."
723,113-468 H.txt,    For Nutrition Programs Administration,"    For Nutrition Programs Administration, the Committee provides .    The Committee does not provide funding for the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion to develop Federal dietary guidance for infants and children from birth to  months of age or to promote the Dietary Guidelines for Americans or MyPlate. The nutrition education services provided through WIC, along with other Federal nutrition education programs, are available to assist with the dietary and nutritional needs of infants and children. The Committee also notes that USDA does significant advertising of the Dietary Guidelines, MyPlate, and other resources to promote healthier lifestyles. These efforts are combined with the ``Let's Move!'' campaign and use of this information by the public and private sectors.    Dietary Guidelines.--The Committee is concerned that the advisory committee for the  Dietary Guidelines for Americans is considering issues outside of the nutritional focus of the panel. Specifically, the advisory committee is showing an interest in incorporating sustainability, climate change, and other environmental factors and production practices into their criteria for establishing the next dietary recommendations, which is clearly outside of the scope of the panel. The Committee directs the Secretary to ensure that the advisory committee focuses only on nutrient and dietary recommendations based upon sound nutrition science and not pursue an environmental agenda. Should environmental or production factors be included in the panel's recommendations to USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services, the Committee expects the Secretary to reject their inclusion in the final  Dietary Guidelines for Americans."

Performance Goals and Budget Justifications.--The Committee stresses the need for defining budgetary needs based on performance goals and outcome-based measures, as defined in the April  report from USDA's Office of Inspector General. These goals should be included in the budget justifications for increases, decreases, and base activities. Furthermore, the Agency's budget submission includes a major object class breakout overall; however, it would be more beneficial for the Committee to have the percentage of spending by major budget object class for each program and funding source, similar to other USDA agency's submissions. The Committee directs the agency to include these criteria in future budget justifications.  Food for Peace Title I Direct Credit and Food for Progress Program"

Pay Cost.--The Committee does not include requested funding for a civilian pay increase across the Commission.    Regulations.--The Committee is concerned about duplicative and overreaching regulations that are resource intensive.

Five-year Strategic Information Technology Plan.--The Committee notes that the Commission did not submit a five-year, strategic technology investment plan per the directive in H. Rpt. -. The Committee directs the Commission to develop the plan. It is essential that the Committee know where and how these investments are to be made with the funding provided in this bill per the President's request for information technology.    Academic Research.--The Committee notes its concern regarding the Commission's reduction of the independent economic research by visiting scholars within the Office of Chief Economist (OCE). Since December , the Commission has reduced the number of economists in the OCE by over %, access to equipment used for research has become limited, and no new visiting academics have joined. It has taken over a year to approve publication of some economic papers, delaying research on issues such as high frequency trading. On May , , MIT professor and former CFTC Chief Economist testified before Congress on high frequency trading. It was revealed that his research was held up by the Commission for over a year. This raises concern given the Commission's pending rule on high frequency trading and the research program as a whole. The Committee will continue to monitor this situation."

The Committee adopts the President's proposed funding level for the Assistant Secretary for Administration.    The Committee provides an increase of  over the  enacted level for the Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement (OPPE) and rejects the reductions proposed in the budget request. The Committee strongly supports the Outreach and Assistance for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Veterans program. This funding is in addition to the  in mandatory funds available in . In a separate provision in Title VII, an additional  for the Farm Opportunities Training and Outreach Program is provided. OPPE is directed to use not more than five percent of this sum for administrative costs.    Adapting to a changing climate.--The Committee directs USDA to conduct a survey on current programs that aid farmers in mitigating and adapting to the effects of the changing climate, including programs that support carbon sequestration in the soil, and identify opportunities to expand this work.    Advertising expenditures.--The Committee believes that, as the largest advertiser in the United States, the federal government should work to ensure fair access to its advertising contracts for small disadvantaged businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women. The Committee directs USDA to include the following information in a report to the Committee  days after enactment of this Act: expenditures for fiscal year  and expected expenditures for fiscal year  and , respectively, for () all contracts for advertising services; and () contracts for the advertising services of socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns (as defined in section (a)() of the Small Business Act ( U.S.C. (a)()), and women- and minority-owned businesses.    Agroterrorism.--The United States enjoys a safe, plentiful, and inexpensive food supply. The Committee views domestic food production as a priority for national security. The Committee directs the Secretary to explore USDA's laboratory and response capacity to address the threat of agroterrorism, and how national response plans can better incorporate agroterrorism. The Committee encourages the Secretary to coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of the Interior, the intelligence agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and other agencies to improve response plans, conduct vulnerability assessments, and expand monitoring and surveillance for agroterrorism. The Committee also encourages the Secretary to focus on bolstering tracking systems for agricultural products, laboratory networks, and border inspection training.    Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Farmers.--The Committee urges the Secretary to measure the effectiveness of USDA's recruitment and outreach plans for the increasing number of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander farmers. The Committee directs the Department to make available required resources in additional Asian American and Pacific Islander languages to reduce any cultural or linguistic barriers for these farmers.    CCC Report.--The Committee directs the Secretary to provide a report on November , , and May , , on planned uses of funding under the authorities of Section  and Section  of the CCC Charter Act.    Census of Agriculture.--The Committee is aware that urban agriculture is a rapidly growing sector of the U.S. agricultural economy and that there is a need to understand emerging agricultural production. The Committee directs the Department to collect data on urban, indoor, and emerging agricultural production, such as community gardens, rooftop farms, greenhouses and indoor farms, in the  Census of Agriculture. The Committee expects the Department to provide resources for this work in its annual budget request to Congress when it begins planning for the  census.    Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Obligations and Commitments.--The Secretary is directed to notify the Committees in writing  days prior to the obligation or commitment of any emergency funds from the CCC.    Communication from USDA.--A collaborative working relationship between the Committee and USDA is necessary to ensure efficient and effective implementation of Congress' funding decisions. USDA is directed to ensure that the Committee is notified of major changes to existing policies and any significant developments in its operations, before providing non-governmental stakeholders such information, before making the changes public and before implementing them.    Design-Build.--The Committee encourages the Department to use the design-build method of project delivery when appropriate.    Distribution of Farm Subsidies.--The Committee directs the Department to provide to the Committees not later than  days after the enactment of this Act a report on the distribution of farm subsidies, low interest loans, and cost-share conservation programs and its impact on minority-owned farms.    ERS/NIFA relocation.--On August , , the Secretary sent the Committees a letter notifying them that he was planning to move the Economic Research Service (ERS), and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture outside of the greater Washington, D.C., area. Seven days later, without waiting the statutorily-required  days after notification, in violation of the reprogramming rules in P.L. -, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, , the Secretary published a Federal Register notice that the Department was seeking expressions of interest from parties interested in housing the two agencies. At no point in this process, however, has USDA solicited public comment on this proposal. Since then, it has moved forward, despite the clearly expressed opposition of many members of the House and Senate. It failed to comply with the direction of the conferees on the  Act to submit all cost benefits for the move and a detailed analysis of any research benefits of a relocation. It has flatly refused numerous requests from this Committee and other members of Congress to provide the initial cost benefit analysis that preceded the decision to go ahead with the proposal. These agencies' mission is to achieve the best science through research that advances U.S. agriculture and our understanding of the agricultural economy. The Committee believes that the Department's proposal puts that mission at risk and the Committee has therefore included bill language to prevent it.    Flexibility in Loan and Loan Guarantee Levels.--The bill includes language to exceed by up to  percent the limitation on loan and loan guarantee levels without budget authority upon written notification to the Committees on Appropriations.    GAO Report on Credit Service to Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers.--Section  of the  Farm Bill mandated a GAO study of the access of socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers to credit. That report is expected to be released this summer. The Committee looks forward to reviewing the report and assessing the need for further work on this issue.    Grain Export Inspection.--The Committee is aware of the ongoing contract negotiations between West Coast grain terminal operators and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and recognizes the importance of reaching an agreement that works for both parties, as a failure to reach an agreement could result in an interruption in grain terminal service that would negatively impact the nation's grain exports. Therefore, the Committee urges all parties to continue negotiating in good faith to ensure an equitable outcome that protects worker rights and benefits is expeditiously reached. The Committee strongly discourages USDA from requiring its grain inspectors to cross a picket line.    Health Care Access for Farmers.--The Department of Agriculture shall conduct a study on access to affordable, ACA-compliant, high-quality health care for individuals and their families who are self-employed on small, locally-owned and family-owned businesses in rural communities. The report should include recommendations for increasing access to health insurance options for those individuals. The Department should submit the report to the Committee  days after enactment of this Act.    International Food Security Technical Assistance.--The Agriculture Improvement Act of  recognized the challenge of global hunger and the need to improve the delivery of assistance to meet immediate food security requirements and to improve nutritional standards for underserved populations. Section  of that Act authorized USDA agencies, including the Food Nutrition and Consumer Services among other relevant agencies, to provide technical assistance to international entities and organizations that develop and improve food and nutrition safety net systems. The Committee notes the trend of worsening food insecurity and the growing instability that may result and urges the Secretary to prioritize the implementation of this provision. The Committee expects a report on the progress of this effort within  days of enactment.    Loan and Grant Programs.--The Committee directs that if an estimate of loan activity for any program funded in Titles II and III of this bill indicates that a limitation on authority to make commitments for a fiscal year will be reached before the end of that fiscal year, or in any event when  percent of the authority to make commitments has been utilized, the Secretary shall promptly notify the Committees through OBPA. The Committee directs the Department, through OBPA, to provide quarterly reports to the Committees on the status of obligations and funds availability for the loan and grant programs provided in this bill.    Moving ERS to the Office of the Chief Economist.--On August , , the Secretary notified the Committees that he planned to move ERS from the Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics (REE) to the Office of the Chief Economist, which is part of the Office of the Secretary. The Under Secretary of REE also serves as USDA's chief scientist. By law, he or she is charged with overseeing all issues involving scientific integrity within the Department. In fact, the Chief Scientist is actually empowered to oppose any efforts to politicize science. The Chief Economist has no such role or power. Keeping ERS within a mission area that is solely devoted to research ensures it will continue to be seen as a first-class, independent research entity. Putting it under the Office of the Secretary puts that at jeopardy. The Committee opposes the proposal and has included bill language to prevent it.    Native American Foods.--Native American tribes suffer among the highest rates of diabetes in the United States. Traditional Native American diets have been shown to be culturally relevant and protective against metabolic diseases such as diabetes. The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) has increased the variety of traditional foods offered in the program. The Committee directs USDA to develop programs in conjunction with Indian Tribal Organizations to restore food ecosystems and revive traditional foods based on dietary preferences of Native American populations. USDA shall continue to collaborate with FDPIR agencies on recommendations for food package changes, with the goal of further increasing the amount and variety of traditional and locally or regionally grown food items offered through the program.    Native Plant Use Preference.--The Committee continues to support the use of locally adapted native plant materials in the undertaking of land management activity on Federal lands under the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture, including in maintenance and in restoration in response to degradation caused by human activity or natural events (such as fire, flood, or infestation). The Committee directs that it be the policy of the USDA that preference shall be made, to the extent practicable, for the use of locally adapted native plant materials in these cases.    Office for Civil Rights.--The Committee requests a report from the Secretary on how the Office intends to manage and avoid recurrent backlogs in cases, including both those involving USDA programs and those involving USDA employees. The report is due by December , .    Pay Costs.--The Committee does not include funding for a civilian pay increase across the Department. Should the President provide a civilian pay increase for fiscal year , it is assumed that the cost of such a pay increase will be absorbed within existing appropriations for fiscal year .    Rural Broadband.--The Committee continues to support the Re-Connect program to increase access to broadband connectivity in unserved rural communities. The Committee continues to direct the Department to target grants and loans issued to areas of the country with the largest broadband coverage gaps. These projects should utilize technology that will maximize coverage of broadband with the most benefit to taxpayers and the rural communities served. Technologies to consider should include, but are not limited to, fiber, cable modem, fixed wireless, and television white space. The bill includes funding for broadband deployment through the Broadband Loan program, Community Connect grant program, Distance Learning and Telemedicine program and an additional  for the Re-Connect program.    Rural Health Liaison.--The Committee directs the Department to designate a Rural Health Liaison in the Office of the Secretary no later than  days after the enactment of this Act. The Office of the Secretary shall work in conjunction with the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy under HHS to ensure that the duties of the Rural Health Liaison enumerated in Section  of the Agriculture Improvement Act are carried out effectively.    Rural Poverty.--In their fiscal year  bills, both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees directed USDA to produce a detailed plan setting forth all USDA resources available to combat rural poverty. The report was due on April , , and more than three years later, it has not been received. The Committee will consider penalizing the Department if it has not received the report before the conference on this bill begins.    Status of House and Senate Report Language.--The Department is directed to include in its fiscal year  Congressional Justification, as a single exhibit, a table listing all deliverables, with a column for due dates if applicable. The Office of Budget and Program Analysis (OBPA) is directed to provide updates on the status of House and Senate reports upon request from the Committees.    USDA-owned Vehicles.--The Committee has included revised bill language related to the number of vehicles the Department owns, similar to that proposed by the administration. However, the Committee was troubled to learn that USDA's concern about the previous language was that it limited the Department to a specific number of vehicles, which USDA was completely unable to certify. The Committee requests a report from the Department within  days after enactment of this Act that describes how it plans to better manage its vehicle fleet."

Carbon Markets.--The Committee recognizes that carbon markets could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide new revenue streams for farmers. The Committee urges the Secretary to explore carbon markets for agriculture and develop common, science-based methodologies for carbon markets.    Drought Mitigation.--The Committee is concerned about severe and prolonged droughts in the United States. The Committee expects the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to utilize all available flexibility, discretion and opportunities to assist producers, irrigators and irrigation districts in implementing area-wide plans to address drought resiliency and mitigation in a way that maintains strong rural and agriculture communities and protects natural resources. Priority should be given to supporting the implementation of major drought response plans, agreements or programs designed to result in conservation of surface water or groundwater.    Harmful Algal Blooms.--The Committee strongly supports and directs funding to NRCS's ongoing work to reduce nutrient loading from agricultural sources that can contribute to the growth of harmful algal blooms. Funding shall be used for targeting of watersheds where harmful algal blooms pose a threat and implementing a variety of conservation systems to address all transport pathways of phosphorus from agricultural land uses. Conservation planning should prioritize fields with the highest risk of elevated phosphorus and/or nitrogen losses.    Monarch Butterfly Populations.--The Committee is aware that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is considering listing the monarch butterfly under the Endangered Species Act. The potential effect of monarchs being listed as threatened or endangered would have significant impacts on agriculture in the U.S. The Committee directs the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to work together in coordination with the states, and private and nonprofit organizations to develop and implement strategies to help protect monarch butterfly populations and preserve the natural habitats critical to their survival. The Secretaries are directed to report back within  days of the passage of this Act on the status of this plan and any other actions the Departments are taking to encourage support of monarch conservation by the agricultural community.    Office of Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production.--The Committee provides  for this office. Of this amount,  is for pilot programs under section (d)() of Subtitle A of the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of , as amended by section  of P.L. -.    Outcomes-Verified Soil Health Program.--The Committee understands the importance of soil health programs that promote on-farm resilience while increasing farmer profitability. The Committee urges the Secretary to establish a voluntary, outcomes-verified soil health program within NRCS, allowing farmers to enroll and demonstrate that recommended soil health benchmarks are being met.    Resource Conservation and Development Councils (RC&Ds).--The Committee recognizes RC&Ds have been valuable partners in conservation and encourages NRCS to continue working with local councils, as appropriate, to ensure conservation programs meet local resource needs.    Sage Grouse Initiative.--The Committee supports NRCS's sage grouse conservation efforts. Through the initiative, NRCS provides technical and financial assistance to help landowners conserve sage grouse habitat on their land. The initiative is an integral part of efforts by federal agencies, several western states, and private landowners to help preclude the listing of the sage grouse as an endangered species.    State Partnerships.--NRCS appropriately partners with States, Territories, and Indian Tribal Organizations to implement activities within its charge and has historically provided direct resources to states to assist with those activities. The Committee understands that many programs offered by NRCS are popular and demand is high. To the extent possible, the Committee encourages NRCS to ensure the equitable allocation of resources between the States, Territories and Indian Tribal Organizations. The Committee directs NRCS to continue providing data on resources provided to the states in the annual budget submission to Congress.    Three-D Elevation Program (DEP).--The U.S. Geological Survey is leading the D Elevation Program, a collaborative initiative to systematically collect accurate digital elevation data nationwide.

The Committee directs the Secretary to submit a report not later than  days after the date of enactment on the number of trainings completed, number of participants and pertinent data and performance measures used to measure program outcomes for fiscal years -.    Climate Adaptation.--The Committee recognizes that the impacts of climate change--including sea level rise and more frequent and severe coastal hazards--pose a significant threat to infrastructure and economic development opportunities in rural communities. Therefore, the Committee encourages Rural Development to partner with USDA's Climate Hubs to better leverage existing USDA programs to provide resources to communities to invest in infrastructure improvements that will enhance resilience to future impacts of climate change.    Community Development.--The Committee is interested in the role that broadband connectivity can play in fostering community and economic development. The Committee urges USDA work collaboratively with communities to identify ways towards addressing complex and long-term impediments towards economic growth. This may include, but not be limited to, a holistic review of how integrating programs, streamlining grant review and increasing community participation may more effectively address economic development challenges. The review should also include the development of metrics that measure economic impact across functions such as telehealth, telecommuting, precision agriculture and the economic benefit to diverse populations. Within  days after the date of enactment, the Committee directs USDA to report to the Committee on its findings.    Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI).--HFFI, through the National Fund Manager, invests in projects that will increase the supply of and demand for healthy foods in underserved communities, through loans, grants, and by providing technical assistance. In order to improve access to healthy food, particularly in rural areas and Tribal communities, the Agriculture Improvement Act of  expands eligible projects to include healthy food enterprises. These food enterprises would include businesses or organizations along the food supply chain such as food hubs; food producers, distributors, processors, and manufacturers; commercial kitchens and food business incubators; mobile markets; and other direct to consumer markets.    High-Cost Universal Service Fund (USF) Recipients with Minimum / Buildout Obligations.--ReConnect funding for service areas where High-Cost USF recipients under the CAF-II auction have buildout obligations of / Mbps or greater for fixed terrestrial broadband can only be requested by the entity that is receiving such USF support. Project sponsors that receive USF support in those areas may only apply for funds that serve those areas from the % loan funding category under the ReConnect Program. For purposes of clarification, this limitation on eligibility shall only apply to those areas (e.g., study areas or census blocks) for which the USF CAF-II recipient is subject to a buildout obligation of / Mbps or greater for fixed terrestrial broadband.    Hub Communities.--The Committee encourages the Department to consider the mission and scope of all program applicants, including community colleges, hospitals and other regional public service entities and their ability to effectively address rural depopulation struggles. These entities are often located in regional ``hub'' communities larger than the program population limits, yet without these critical services many of the surrounding smaller towns could not exist and prosper. The Committee encourages the Secretary to make grants and loans available to these institutions, located in rural areas as defined by current law and serve rural areas.    Persistent Poverty Areas.--The Committee supports targeted investments in impoverished areas, particularly in persistent poverty counties. To understand how programs funded through the Department are serving these areas, the Committee directs the Department to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate on the percentage of funds allocated by each rural development program in fiscal years ,  and  and estimates for fiscal year  serving individuals living in persistent poverty counties. The Department shall submit the report to the Committees within  days of enactment.    Placemaking Approach to Rural Development and Broadband.--In order to maximize the efficacy of investment in rural communities, the Committee is interested in learning what factors determine the greatest level of success for broadband resources. The Committee believes that the Department should consider how communities can increase the social, cultural, and quality of life benefits of broadband beyond the historical functional benefits provided to schools, healthcare facilities and services, and businesses. The USDA should issue a request for proposals to identify a public-private partnership or partnerships with expertise and experience working with rural communities in ``place-making'' as a way to foster simultaneously the adoption of broadband services and the creation of greater social and cultural vitality. Selection criteria must include geographic and ethnic diversity as well as such factors as the revitalization and shaping of future town centers, community and county wellbeing and economic vitality, and the enhancement of full community participation in creating growth strategies. An annual report shall be provided to Congress on the accelerators of and impediments to success of implementation of broadband, integration of all rural development programs and drivers for making a place more livable.    Qualified Opportunity Zones.--The Committee recognizes that Qualified Opportunity Zones were created to incentivize greater private-sector investments in rural and economically distressed communities. Given the critical role that USDA Rural Development programs play in supporting economic development opportunities in these communities, the Committee encourages the Under Secretary for Rural Development to develop strategies to leverage existing RD resources to support greater investment in communities located in or adjacent to a Qualified Opportunity Zone.    ReConnect Program.--The Committee directs the Rural Utilities Service (RUS), following the first round of applications to the Rural e-Connectivity Pilot Program, to convene interested stakeholders including, but not limited to, telecommunication companies, rural electric cooperatives and utilities, internet service providers and municipalities to gather comments and recommendations for improving program implementation. The Committee recognizes that this is the first round of funding and commends the RUS for efforts to date in establishing and administering the program. The Committee also recognizes possible unintended consequences and unanticipated obstacles may have arisen from the program design to program implementation stages. Specifically, the Committee is concerned about the lack of access to ReConnect funds for entities other than the CAF-II auction recipient in a census block. Currently there is no connectivity requirement, such as number of households served, for these funds, and therefore many rural Americans are still left without broadband access. The Committee believes that all Americans should have access to reliable and affordable broadband, and urges the USDA to amend the ReConnect eligibility requirements in order to better provide service to an accurate number of households, grant recipients, and census block areas. Given the speed, anticipated demand and importance of expanding broadband infrastructure in rural areas, it is imperative to have all interested stakeholders engaged to make best use of taxpayer resources.    Rural Energy Savings Program (RESP).--The Committee supports RESP and the opportunity it provides to launch or expand energy efficiency financing programs. The Committee urges the Department to conduct outreach to co-ops to build awareness of the program.    Veterinary Care Facilities.--Due to recent decline of and urgent need for veterinarians to serve in rural and underserved areas, the Committee expects USDA to give high priority to animal and veterinary care facilities for receipt of loans and grants through Rural Development programs including Community Facilities Loan and Grant Programs and the Rural Business Service programs."
778,116-107 H.txt,    For Salaries and Expenses of the Rural Development mission area,"    For Salaries and Expenses of the Rural Development mission area, the Committee provides an appropriation of .    Rural Development Staffing.--The Committee is concerned by the pace of operations at the Rural Development (RD) state offices due to reported staffing shortages. With authority over sizable financial resources, these programs are uniquely poised to provide essential services to and increase the economic competitiveness of underserved rural areas. However, the Committee is aware that a lack of staff at program offices has created a cyclical backlog of applications. Such delays and uncertainty deter potential applicants and fundamentally undercut the programs potential impact. The Committee includes an additional  for salaries and expenses to support , total staff years and directs the Department to increase hiring at State offices to fulfill Rural Development's commitment towards improving customer service.    Rural Hospitals.--Many rural hospitals have closed in recent years, with many more vulnerable. Rural hospitals are an essential pillar of their communities and are necessary to create the economic growth that is direly needed in rural communities. USDA has the experience and expertise to help struggling rural hospitals negotiate, reorganize, and revitalize. Providing assistance to strengthen their sustainability will protect taxpayer investments and help preserve the future of rural health care. Building on the  Farm Bill Joint Explanatory Statement, the Committee provides  to expand technical assistance to vulnerable hospitals in the Community Facilities portfolio to protect the government funds already expended and preserve access to health care in rural communities. In addition, where appropriate, the Committee directs the Department to provide technical assistance to those hospitals that seek to refinance their debt under the new provision for refinancing certain hospital debt as authorized by Section  of the  Farm Bill, in order to protect the investment of government funds expended for this purpose.

Rural areas continue to face immense needs and challenges in attaining safe and clean water, and this program provides targeted and coordinated support for these communities and is essential for the delivery of safe, dependable and affordable water and wastewater to rural America. The Committee believes this program is complementary, not duplicative, of other federal programs and critical in supporting quality of life, economic development and health to rural communities.    Domestic Preference.--The bill includes language specifying that RUS' Rural Water and Waste Disposal program account projects utilizing iron and steel shall use iron and steel products produced in the United States. RUS shall apply the Environmental Protection Agency's definition of public water systems while implementing the domestic preference provision.    Open Access Infrastructure.--The Committee is aware that public entities have invested in open access fiber infrastructure that is facilitating the delivery of high-speed broadband services by licensed telecommunications providers, including the model pioneered by public port authorities. The Committee understands that while particular open access fiber projects may be eligible for RUS grants and loans, more generally, there exist significant barriers to government backing for these types of open access investments. The Committee believes RUS programs should support financially-feasible open access infrastructure projects that meet program goals. The Committee urges RUS to ensure the agency's criteria and application processes provide for fair consideration of open access projects by accounting for the unique structures and opportunities such projects present in advancing broadband deployment in unserved and underserved communities.    Sewage Management.--The Committee supports the development of a multi-faceted solution to the problem of raw sewage discharge in rural communities.    Technical Assistance and Training Grant Program.--The Committee provides  for water and waste technical assistance and training grants. Up to  of these resources shall be used to support the national apprenticeship/workforce development program to ensure a future pipeline of workers to provide clean and safe water for the public.    Water Supplies for Very Small Communities.--The Committee is aware of concerns that RUS grant programs do not adequately help small, disadvantaged, and severely disadvantaged communities access the funding and expertise necessary to develop sustainable water supplies or otherwise improve their wastewater systems, and it directs the agency to focus its efforts to assist these communities with predevelopment planning to help them address their water supply needs.    The following table provides the Committee's recommendations as compared to the budget request:"

The Committee urges the Under Secretary for Rural Development to continue awarding grants that support technology upgrades that provide additional healthcare access and education through the use of telemedicine and expanded services in community health centers through partnerships with hub medical centers.    Indian Country Broadband.--The Committee recognizes the persistent digital divide in America and the acute impacts this has on educational, health, public safety, and economic opportunities in Indian country. The Committee urges the Department to explore means to expand high-speed internet deployment in Indian country utilizing current programs. Specifically, the Committee encourages the USDA to work with tribal communities to better understand the unique infrastructure challenges they face to ensure that they are not held at a competitive disadvantage when competing for these resources."
793,116-107 H.txt,    For the Office of the Under Secretary for Food,"    For the Office of the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services, the Committee provides an appropriation of .    Cross-government Coordination on Nutrition. The committee calls on USDA to lead a whole of government approach and create a report on responsibilities of each agency and how they will coordinate the biochemical, physiologic, nutritional and population health effects of government recommendation for nutrition and food consumption in America.    Innovative Technologies.--The Committee looks forward to the results of the SNAP online purchasing pilot. The Committee recognizes the need for enhanced efficiency in nutrition programs and supports FNS as it continues to implement and evaluate new technologies.    Nutrition Education Coordination.--USDA plays an important role in offering nutrition education and training through programs such as SNAP-Ed, EFNEP and WIC. However, the Committee is concerned regarding the lack of communication and coordination between the five main nutrition education programs (SNAP-Ed, EFNEP, Team Nutrition, WIC and FINI/Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program) at USDA. USDA is directed to report to the Committees within  days of the enactment of this Act on the steps it will take to better coordinate nutrition education, utilize experts from CNPP in the Dietary Guidelines development, and track program effectiveness across each program.    Public Release of Information.--The Committee directs FNS to continue making all policy documents related to the WIC program (including, but not limited to, instructions, memoranda, guidance, and questions and answers) available to the public on the Internet within one week of their release to WIC state administrators.    Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (SFMNP).--The Committee recognizes the success of the SFMNP, with over , low-income seniors able to benefit from , farmers at , farmers' markets as well as , roadside stands and  community supported agriculture programs in FY . The Committee encourages USDA to improve eligible participants' awareness of the SFMNP through education and outreach efforts. The Committee is critically aware of the need for SFMNP in low income communities. The Committee directs FNS to research the backlog of states requesting SFMNP funding and to deliver their findings to the Committees within  days of enactment.    Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).--The Committee is aware of the challenges people face when transitioning out of incarceration, including finding employment. Access to nutrition assistance is critical to successfully reentering society as it offers temporary assistance to ex-offenders as they search for stable employment. The Committee directs the Department to research and report ways states especially those who have lifted or modified the SNAP drug felony ban--can best serve this population, such as but not limited to: pre-release applications for SNAP and employment and training programs for this population. The Committee directs the Department to share those findings in a report with the Appropriations Committees and disseminate those best practices to state agencies no later than  days after enactment of this act. Such findings should also be made available online for the public to utilize.    WIC Realignment.--The Committee is concerned with the proposed realignment of state WIC agencies within FNS regional offices, which could have unintended consequences on resource distribution and multi-state projects. The Committee urges FNS to reach out to stakeholders and requests a briefing within  days of enactment on how the realignment is proceeding and how state and Indian Tribal Organizations' concerns are being addressed."
794,116-107 H.txt,    For the Child Nutrition Programs,"    For the Child Nutrition Programs, the Committee provides  which includes  for school meals equipment grants,  for the Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) for Children Demonstration, and  for technical assistance related to sodium.    Cost of School Meals.--The Committee is interested in understanding the cost of school meals in Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The Committee directs FNS to include all territories, including those that receive block grants, in any studies it does on the Child Nutrition Programs.    Food Waste.--Food waste also remains a concern in the school meals program. Schools should have the ability to serve leftover, compliant foods in a quick, timely manner in accordance with food safety requirements. The Committee urges USDA to consider implementing flexibilities in allowing schools to utilize these foods in a more efficient manner.    Length of School Meals.--The Committee is aware that providing adequate time to eat healthy school meals increases the consumption of fruits and vegetables and minimizes food waste. The Committee encourages the Department, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Education, to develop best practices to ensure school schedules provide students adequate time to eat healthy school meals.    School Breakfast Expansion Grants.--The Committee is concerned that while participation in the School Breakfast Program is increasing, many children who are eligible for the School Breakfast Program are not participating. Therefore, the Committee provides  for grants for expansion of the School Breakfast Program, of which  is dedicated to the U.S. territories.    School Nutrition Standards.--The Committee directs the Department to publish on its website data on the compliance of school food authorities with respect to the nutritional requirements under section (f) of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act. The data reported should include the total number of school food authorities in each state, the number of school food authorities in compliance with the requirements, and the percentage of school food authorities in compliance with the requirements by state.    Sodium Reduction.-- The Committee recognizes the need for additional support for schools to meet the sodium-reduction targets and, of the funds made available for Team Nutrition, provides  for technical assistance. Within one year of enactment, the Committees requests a report on the use of the funds to provide schools with technical assistance, training resources, and mentoring to meet the sodium-reduction targets. Further, the Committee requests information on USDA's plans to update the sodium-reduction targets consistent with the  Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommendations on sodium. The Committee strongly encourages USDA to work with industry and other stakeholders to ensure there that there are a wide variety of lower-sodium options on the market from which schools can procure.    Summer EBT.--The Committee recognizes the benefits the Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) program has had on reducing childhood hunger. The Committee provides increased funding to serve more children and directs the Department to expand the Summer EBT program into new areas while also continuing to serve areas that have received such funding in prior years. Additionally, the Committee is aware that the Summer EBT evaluation suggests greater barriers for participation, redemption and exhaustion of benefits and higher administrative costs in the Summer EBT WIC model than in the Summer EBT SNAP model. Therefore, the Committee encourages the Secretary to prioritize Summer EBT projects through the SNAP model.    Training for School Food Service Personnel.--The Committee recognizes the value of webinars, conference calls, and online courses in expanding the reach of trainings for school food service personnel. For any in-person trainings for school food service personnel, all efforts should be made to ensure those trainings are held during normal working hours. In the event such training is scheduled outside working hours, all efforts should be made to inform food service personnel of the necessity of the training; the committee also encourages the Department to work with states on compensation for personnel participating in such training programs under such circumstances.    Yogurt.--The Committee is aware that after soliciting Requests for Information on the food crediting system for the school lunch and breakfast programs, FNS decided to maintain the current crediting standard for strained, high-protein yogurt. The Committee encourages the Secretary to continue evaluating how strained, high-protein yogurt is credited based on the best available science. The Committee also requests a briefing from the Department, within  days of enactment, to better understand food crediting in the Child Nutrition programs, particularly how decisions are made regarding products containing high protein.    The following table reflects the Committee recommendations for the child nutrition programs:"
795,116-107 H.txt,    For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,"    For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, the Committee provides an appropriation of . The Committee provides  for the breastfeeding peer counselor program and  for infrastructure. The Committee encourages FNS to support innovative technologies that can improve rural and urban participants' access to lactation consultants particularly outside of normal WIC clinic business hours.    USDA data shows that WIC participation rates have decreased steadily since fiscal year . The President's budget request includes a projection of an average monthly participation rate of . million women, infants, and children for fiscal year .    USDA is estimating recovery and carryover funds to be higher than average. Furthermore, the Secretary has a WIC contingency reserve fund as a safety net to meet unexpected demand. With lower participation rates, higher carryover funds, and an ample reserve fund, the Committee provides funding that will ensure all eligible participants will be served.    The Committee will continue to monitor WIC participation, carryover funds, and food costs and take additional action as necessary to ensure that funding provided in fiscal year  remains sufficient to serve all eligible applicants.    Breastfeeding Rates.--The Committee is interested in understanding how to improve breastfeeding rates, especially as higher rates have been linked to lower childhood obesity. The Committee also recognizes that there are many barriers to breastfeeding as detailed in CDC's  Breastfeeding Report Card. Each year, FNS awards some state agencies bonus awards for their successful efforts in promoting and supporting breastfeeding among WIC participants. The Committee directs FNS to review the work of awardees from previous years to look for commonalities and trends. FNS should develop a report, within  days of enactment, that summarizes these best practices. This report should include a summary of the factors that prevent or impede breastfeeding and recommendations on how they can be addressed.    Zika Outreach and Education.--The Committee encourages the Department to continue its education and outreach efforts through the WIC program to provide pregnant women with the information they need to prevent Zika."
796,116-107 H.txt,    For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,"    For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Committee provides . The total amount includes  for a contingency reserve to be used only in the amount necessary.    College Hunger.--The Committee is concerned that SNAP-eligible students who are food-insecure lack proper clarity and information about resources available to them. Therefore, the Committee directs the Food and Nutrition Service to make information available on its website regarding student SNAP eligibility requirements easier to understand and more accessible. The Committee further directs FNS regional offices to collect and review information about existing SNAP flexibilities and examples of approaches state SNAP agencies are taking to assist eligible college students to access SNAP benefits and share such information with state SNAP agencies. It also encourages the Secretary to work with the Department of Education to share these best practices with higher education institutions. The Committee directs FNS to provide a briefing to the Committee on Appropriations on its plan for executing these items no later than  days after enactment.    Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) Demonstration Project for Tribal Organizations.--The Committee supports FDPIR and the ability of tribal organizations to enter into  self-determination contracts for the procurement of FDPIR foods, which would promote tribal sovereignty and allow tailoring of this vital program to meet specific tribal cultural and local needs. The Committee provides  for the  Tribal Self Governance Demonstration Program for Tribal Organizations as described in Section  of P.L. -. Additionally, the Committee encourages the Secretary to review Department-wide nutrition programs, with the full participation of Indian tribes and tribal organizations, to consider ways in which more Native foods can be incorporated into these programs where possible and the possibility of allowing tribes to provide input into federal nutritional guidance that reflects unique Indian tribal needs.    Nutrition Assistance Program (NAP) Study.--The Committee supports ongoing efforts by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to shift NAP to SNAP. The Committee recognizes this will require Puerto Rico to build additional capacity to operate SNAP according to federal rules. The Committee provides  million (of which no less than  million shall be made available to Puerto Rico to support the process) to develop a report to Congress that updates the administrative, operational, and program integrity parts of chapter IV of the  report ``Implementing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in Puerto Rico: A Feasibility Study'' and includes a detailed plan with specific steps and timelines for USDA and the Commonwealth to address and remedy identified gaps. The Secretary is to report the results to the Committees no later than September , . In addition, the Committee provides  million for the Commonwealth to fund a preliminary planning process regarding technology requirements and costs to operate SNAP and requests the Commonwealth to provide a report to the Committees on its efforts no later than September , .    Nutrition Assistance Program (NAP) Transparency.--The Committee recognizes the importance of transparency and data availability for Puerto Rico's Nutrition Assistance Program (NAP). The Committee directs the Secretary to publish information regarding monthly enrollment, issuance data and the Commonwealth's State Plan of Operations for NAP on the Department's web site. The Committee further directs the Secretary, acting through the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, to measure the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan in Puerto Rico. The Department is directed to report to the Committee no later than  days after enactment of this Act on the status of the Department's efforts to achieve greater transparency to Puerto Rico's Nutrition Assistance Program.    The following table reflects the Committee recommendations for SNAP:"
797,116-107 H.txt,    The Committee provides an appropriation of  for the Commodity Assistance Program. The recommended funding level for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program is . The Committee recognizes the importance of the CSFP,"    The Committee provides an appropriation of  for the Commodity Assistance Program. The recommended funding level for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program is . The Committee recognizes the importance of the CSFP, which improves the health of low-income elderly persons at least  years of age by supplementing their diets with nutritious foods. The amount provided fully funds expected caseload.    The Committee recommendation maintains the  levels of  for the Farmers' Market Nutrition Program,  for administrative funding for The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) and  for the Food Donations Programs for Pacific Island Assistance.    TEFAP Handling and Distribution Costs.--In addition to grant funds supporting commodity handling and distribution costs, the bill permits states to use up to  percent of the funds provided for purchasing TEFAP commodities to help with the costs of storing, transporting, and distributing commodities. The Committee expects state agencies to consult with their emergency feeding organizations on the need for the conversion of such funds."

801,116-107 H.txt,    For the Foreign Agricultural Service,"    For the Foreign Agricultural Service, the Committee provides an appropriation of  and a transfer of  for a total appropriation of .    The Committee provides increases in funding for International Cooperative Administrative Support Services, Capital Security Cost Sharing, locally employed staff, and biotech programs. The Committee does not maintain the  increase for the Country Strategy Support Fund.    Farmer-to-Farmer.--The Committee is interested in improving the efficacy of dollars that serve to improve local food production around the world through the Global Food Security Act and the Feed the Future Initiative. International food security is beneficial for reducing poverty and risk of conflict and can also serve to increase the buying power of American goods and services. The John Ogonowski and Doug Bereuter Farmer-to-Farmer program (Farmer-to-Farmer) is a program that brings American ingenuity to our investment in local food production. The Committee is interested in a stronger coordination between USAID and USDA for Farmer-to-Farmer. The Committee is interested in USAID ensuring that recommendations from USDA are considered in identifying the Country Coordinators for Feed the Future priority countries. Coordinators should develop a clear strategy for determining what expertise is needed to accelerate success and overcome obstacles that impede more effective local food production. This should also include a pull strategy for Farmer-to-Farmer volunteers, which is defined as requiring the country/program to locally define what expertise is needed based on insights from the field rather than from the central office. The efforts of the partnership with USAID should be strengthened by a stronger relationship with USDA, by incorporating working groups in Washington. In addition, USAID should seek the expertise of USDA in developing streamlined metrics for assessment of program effectiveness, including measures in addition to child stunting such as geocentric yield analysis. The Committee is interested in USAID seeking recommendations from USDA for maximizing the efficacy of Farmer-to-Farmer and for developing a demonstration in a select few Feed the Future countries. The Committee notes that last year's House Report directed USDA to enhance its participation in the Farmer-to-Farmer program by expanding the role of the agricultural officer in Target Countries, which are determined in accordance with the Global Food Security Act. The Committee notes that the agricultural officer can help improve the Farmer-to-Farmer program by determining what expertise is needed to overcome obstacles that impede local food production and incorporating insights from the field. The Committee directs that the USDA agricultural officer continue to work with USAID staff to achieve the food security goals of Farmer-to-Farmer. The Committee directs USDA to provide a briefing to the Committee on these efforts and how USDA can help maximize the efficacy of Farmer-to-Farmer. In addition, the Committee directs USAID to coordinate with USDA on incorporating the role of the agricultural officer to maximize the efficacy of the Farmer-to-Farmer program.    International Agricultural Education Fellowship.--The Committee provides  for this program as authorized in the  Farm Bill. The Committee is interested in exploring how this program can supplement ongoing efforts at the Foreign Agricultural Service. Prior to issuing any funding awards, the Committee directs USDA to brief the Committees on how the International Agricultural Education Fellowship program will work in collaboration with other ongoing Foreign Agricultural Service programs to achieve USDA's goals.    U.S.-Central America, Mexico Cooperation.--The Committee directs FAS to work with its counterparts in Central America and Mexico to develop agricultural working groups focused on improving the efficiency of the agricultural inspection process and agricultural trade facilitation issues. In addition, FAS shall use existing programs for academic exchanges in agriculture-related fields of study in this region. The Committee directs FAS to brief the Committees on its efforts not later than  days after the enactment of this Act.  FOOD FOR PEACE TITLE I DIRECT CREDIT AND FOOD FOR PROGRESS PROGRAM"

808,116-107 H.txt,    For the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC),"    For the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Committee provides an appropriation of  of which  is for the purchase of IT and  is for the Inspector General.    Aluminum.--The Committee is aware of concerns about pricing by aluminum end users. It is the CFTC's mission to protect market users and the public from fraud, manipulation, and abusive practices related to the sale of commodity and financial futures and options, and to foster open, competitive, and financially sound futures and options markets. The Committee therefore requests that the CFTC report back no later than  days after enactment of the bill on the state of the aluminum futures markets.    Cross-Border Harmonization.--The Committee strongly encourages the CFTC to work with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to harmonize the definition of a ``U.S. person.'' Currently, the definition of a ``U.S. person'' differs between the two agencies, which can result in operational challenges and potentially different regulatory treatment of entities transacting in otherwise similar instruments. Global firms face significant costs and burdens if the CFTC's and SEC's regulatory approaches produce different outcomes regarding whether an entity or transaction would be subject to the Dodd-Frank Act. Derivatives transactions for swaps and security-based swaps that are traded typically by the same trading desk or desks should not be analyzed differently. The Committee urges these agencies to work together in an expeditious manner toward a consistent definition of a U.S. person.    Virtual Currency Monitoring.--The advent of virtual currency markets has presented several new challenges for the Commission in its efforts to carry out its mission. Each virtual currency derivatives contract currently ties its price in some way, through various settlement processes, to prices of virtual currency on certain cash market platforms. This underlying virtual currency cash market is relatively nascent, and the platforms operating in the cash market remain largely unregulated, with the Commission having only limited enforcement authority over the cash market. Those features of the underlying cash market platforms have led the Commission to note multiple risks to the markets. Therefore, the Committee encourages the Commission's ongoing efforts, in coordination with other financial regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, to continue monitoring virtual currencies, including Bitcoin futures contracts, and to detect, investigate, and prosecute fraud and manipulation in these markets. The Commission is directed to prepare a report on how to better protect virtual currency investors and promote American competitiveness in this evolving global marketplace. This report should include, but is not limited to, a discussion of how to protect investors against fraud and manipulation involving virtual currency. This report is to be made available on the Commission website within  days of the date of enactment of this Act."
809,116-107 H.txt,    For the limitation on the expenses of the Farm Credit Administration (FCA),"    For the limitation on the expenses of the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), the Committee provides .    Public/private partnerships.--The Committee recognizes the value of public/private partnerships in financing rural community facilities and other similar projects, as well as the role the Farm Credit System (FCS) can play in expanding these partnerships. The Committee also recognizes that the Farm Credit Act of , as amended, provides authority for FCS institutions to make investments in vital rural community facilities and supports improving the Farm Credit Administration's current process of approving these investments. To help the Committee consider ways it can encourage these partnerships, the Farm Credit Administration is directed to report back to the Committee within  days of the date of enactment of this Act on the current ways in which the FCS participates in these partnerships and on options to enhance and expand FCS's lending and investment opportunities to increase these partnerships and investment projects in rural America."
810,110-258 H.txt,    For the Office of the Secretary,"    For the Office of the Secretary, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The Committee recommendation includes a total of  for cross-cutting trade negotiations and biotechnology resources.    The Committee does not include funding for provisional reconstruction team as requested.    Explanatory Notes.--The Committee appreciates receiving the detailed information provided in the Explanatory Notes prepared by the Department and relies heavily on this information when considering budget proposals. These materials have traditionally been prepared for the sole use of the Appropriations Committee in a format consistent with the organization and operation of the programs and the structure of the Appropriations Act. At the direction of the Office of Management and Budget, the Department has changed the format and content of these materials to focus on broader goals and objectives rather than the major program structure followed in the Act and in the actual conduct of the programs. For fiscal year  and future years, the Department is directed to present Explanatory Notes in a format consistent with the presentation used for the fiscal year  Budget. Any deviations from that format are to be approved in advance by the Committee.    State Office Collocation.--The Committee continues to direct that any reallocation of resources related to the collocation of state offices scheduled for  and subsequent years is subject to the Committee's reprogramming procedures.    Administrative Provision.--The Committee directs the Secretary to advise the Committees on Appropriations in writing of the status of all reports requested of the Department in this bill, at the time of submission of the fiscal year  budget and quarterly thereafter.    The Committee reminds the Secretary that all correspondence related to the directives in this bill must be addressed to the Committee on Appropriations.    High-Risk List.--The Committee directs USDA and FDA to work with GAO on a plan whose implementation would result in food safety being removed from GAO's High-Risk List and to submit a report on that plan to the Committee by October , .    Minors in Agriculture.--The Committee is concerned with the number of injuries and deaths of minors in agriculture. Current child labor law permits children as young as  years of age to work in the fields under very specific limitations, such as non-hazardous work that occurs beyond school hours. However, according to a  U.S. Government Accountability Office report, workplace hazards, including pesticides, heat stress, heavy machinery, and sharp tools, combine to injure more than , children on farms every year. Between  and , more than  percent of all work-related deaths of minors in the U.S. occurred in agriculture. The Committee directs the Secretary of USDA, in collaboration with the Secretary of Labor, to develop a plan to address injuries and deaths of minors in agriculture and to submit the plan to the Committee by March , .    The Committee is concerned that the USDA's RUS Broadband Loan Program has not made sufficient corrective actions in response to the critical September  report by the USDA Office of the Inspector General. In particular, the Committee is concerned that instead of focusing on un-served rural areas that have no broadband service, the RUS continues to grant loans to areas where broadband service is already being offered by private providers. Such practices penalize private providers that have already built broadband systems in these areas. Such practices also do nothing to further the goal of bringing broadband to un-served areas with no broadband while also putting at risk taxpayer dollars by funding projects where private sector competition already exists. The Committee directs the USDA's Office of the Inspector General to reexamine the RUS Broadband Loan Program and issue a comprehensive follow-up report, which also details in particular:     How many un-served households were included in approved RUS Broadband Loan Program applications.     How many applications were granted to applicants proposing to serve areas where one or more private broadband providers already offered service.     How many approved loans (and their total amount) have defaulted since the program's inception.     How many applicants who have been approved for loans have subsequently withdrawn from the program due to the eventually discovered infeasibility of the approved project.    Apple Moth.--The Committee encourages the Secretary to utilize all funds necessary from the Commodity Credit Corporation to carry out the recommendation of the USDA science advisory panel to eradicate in California the light brown apple moth.    With two thirds of the USDA budget devoted to nutrition programs, the Committee urges the Department of Agriculture to thoroughly examine ways of linking local agriculture to nutrition program procurement. To the extent possible, the committee encourages the Department to identify funding sources to link local agriculture directly with nutrition programs serving seniors, school breakfast and lunch programs. The Committee notes growing interest in local procurement among school food service systems across the country. Local procurement can help farmers develop consistent markets for fresh food produced locally.

E-gov assessments.--The Committee is deeply troubled by the escalating costs of electronic government (``e-gov'') initiatives. Between fiscal years  and , the amount USDA agencies paid for e-gov initiatives rose by  percent--from  to . Within these totals, the amount for presidential e-gov initiatives increased over two and a half times--from  in  to  in . Since these costs are borne by the agencies and Congress did not provide increases to the agencies for these costs, in most circumstances the agencies must absorb the rising costs of e-gov initiatives by cutting back on program funding.    The Committee supports efforts to make government more efficient and user-friendly, but not at the expense of core programs. The Committee directs the Office of the Chief Information Officer to scrutinize the need for each e-gov initiative, both presidential and departmental; to consider its benefit to the mission of each agency; and to limit  and  spending to the  level wherever possible. A report should be submitted to the Committee by January , , outlining the OCIO's findings and the funding levels for both years. In addition, the Department's fiscal year  budget should include a justification for funding each initiative, a description of how increases would be funded, and the impact on agency programs of the funding increases.    Audit recommendations not achieving management decision within  days.--The Committee has received from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the record a list of audit reports where management decisions have not been achieved within  days. Included on the list was one audit report for OCIO, with several open recommendations. The Committee supports OIG in its efforts to reach agreement within  days and directs OCIO to send the Committee a report by October ,  with a plan for reaching management decision on the outstanding issues."

The Committee recommendation includes funding for the Common Computing Environment activities in the appropriate agency accounts.    Since fiscal year , Congress has appropriated over  for the modernization and integration of information systems in USDA's county field offices. The Committee has fully supported this effort, but will expect to see reduced or level funding levels for this account in future budget submissions as a result of anticipated efficiencies and economies of scale.    The Committee directs the Department to continue reporting to the Committee on Appropriations on a quarterly basis on the implementation of the Common Computing Environment."
817,110-258 H.txt,    For the Office of the Chief Financial Officer,"    For the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The Committee includes authority in section  of the general provisions that allows for unobligated discretionary balances transferred to the Working Capital Fund to be used for the acquisition of plant and capital equipment for the delivery of the Financial Management Modernization Initiative.    The Committee directs the Department to submit a report concurrent with the Department's annual budget submission for the following fiscal year, updating the Committee on its contracting out policies, including agency budgets for contracting out, for fiscal year . The Committee is continuing bill language requiring the submission of the report on contracting out policies and agency budgets, prior to use of any funds appropriated to the Office of the Chief Financial Officer for FAIR Act or Circular A- activities.    The Committee directs the Secretary to continue providing quarterly reports on the status of continuity of operations of the National Finance Center, remote mirror imaging, the reestablishment of payroll and cross-servicing operations and function in New Orleans, selection for a new alternate worksite, and plans for the new primary computing facility.    Assessments.--As with charges for electronic government initiatives, the assessments that the Department charges its agencies for other government- and department-wide activities have risen steeply. Between fiscal years  and , these assessments increased by almost  percent--from . million to . million. Since these assessments are borne by the agencies, and Congress did not specifically provide increases to the agencies for these costs, most of the funding for the increase has come at the expense of programs.    The Committee directs the Office of the Chief Financial Officer to scrutinize the need for each activity, excluding electronic government initiatives; to consider its benefit to the mission of each agency; and to limit  and  spending to the  level wherever possible. A report should be submitted to the Committee by January , , outlining OCFO's findings and funding levels for both years. In addition, the Department's fiscal year  budget should include a justification for funding each activity, how increases would be funded, and the impact on funding the increases on agency programs. The Department should also include an exhibit showing assessments by agency in addition to the exhibit submitted in the FY  budget."

The Committee recommendation includes an increase of  for additional high priority work on waste, fraud and abuse, public health, and program integrity. Of this amount,  is for continued work on waste, fraud and abuse issues related to crop insurance and farm payments. The Committee provides this increase as part of a long-term effort to rebuild the resources of the Office of Inspector General (OIG).    The Committee notes that the transfer of personnel, but not the funds, to the Homeland Security Office provides additional resources for the OIG to carry out its audit and investigative functions.    The Committee greatly values the OIG staff and relies on their work extensively. OIG serves as the eyes and ears of the public. While the exact methodology of the calculation may be subject to dispute, there is no question that OIG's work has saved the taxpayers millions of dollars and improved the integrity and operation of numerous programs within USDA.    Audit recommendations not achieving management decision within  days.--The Committee appreciates receiving for the record OIG's list of audit reports where management decisions have not been achieved within  days.

The devastating phenomenon that has affected bees, referred to as colony collapse disorder (CCD), is seriously affecting the ability of U.S. beekeepers to maintain adequate bee supplies that are essential for the production of honey and for pollination. Pollination is responsible for an estimated  billion in added crop value, particularly for specialty crops such as almonds and other nuts, berries, fruits, and vegetables. The Committee understands that the ARS is conducting federal research to attempt to identify the cause or causes of CCD. The Committee notes that ARS is spending approximately  on bee research in fiscal year , and strongly encourages the agency to maintain this funding level for this vital program in fiscal year .    Plum Island Animal Disease Center.--The Committee directs that none of the funds appropriated to the Agricultural Research Service for the Advanced Animal Vaccine Project at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center may be directed for any other use by the Department of Homeland Security.    Nutrition research.--The Committee recognizes the importance of plant genetic and nutrition research as it relates to finding solutions for America's obesity concerns. The North Carolina Research Campus in Kannapolis, North Carolina, will co-locate two important groups of scientists from the University of North Carolina (UNC) School System that would combine expertise in agricultural genetics and production with nutrition scientists. The Committee encourages the USDA/ARS to work with the UNC system to establish a public/private partnership at the Kannapolis research campus and to look for new ways to address current and future health concerns.

Food safety.--The Committee recognizes the contributions that the Food Animal Residue Avoidance Databank (FARAD) has made toward ensuring the security of the nation's food supply. The Committee is concerned that, although USDA is fully aware of the public reliance on the database and its importance in maintaining food safety, it has continued to rely on Congress to earmark funds for the initiative, neither requesting funding in its annual budget submission nor providing another source for this information, which relates directly to the department's core mission. The Committee directs USDA to report to the Committees on Appropriations in the House and Senate within  days of enactment on its long-term plans to maintain the critical function that FARAD has provided in protecting the U.S. livestock industry from accidental or deliberate contamination.    The following table reflects the amount provided by the Committee:    The Committee recommendation includes funding for other Special Research Grants as follows:    The Committee recommendation includes funding for other Federal Administration grants as follows:"

The Committee is aware of the proposal for user fees in the President's budget, but does not recommend establishing such fees in annual appropriations acts and will consider such fees should they achieve authorization.    Audit recommendations not achieving management decision within  days.--The Committee has received from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the record a list of audit reports where management decisions have not been achieved within  days. Included on the list were four audit reports for APHIS, with a number of open recommendations. The Committee supports OIG in its efforts to reach agreement within  days and directs APHIS to send the Committee a report by October ,  with a plan for reaching management decision on all outstanding issues.    International Activities.--The Committee recommendation does not include additional funding for international activities. According to APHIS budget documents, in fiscal year , the agency had  staff years and spent almost  in over  overseas locations. For fiscal year , APHIS has requested an additional  staff years and an increase of  for three different programs to establish new overseas offices or add to current offices. This would bring the budget for international activities to almost .    While the Committee appreciates APHIS' work in helping resolve unfair trade barriers, it is not clear what is being accomplished by the various APHIS programs with this significant amount of money. Along with the budget submission for fiscal year , APHIS should submit to the Committee a comprehensive strategic plan for its international activities. The plan should include details of current activities, locations of where they are conducted, number of people, amount of money, and results being achieved. In addition, the plan should include long-term goals, strategies on how to reach these goals, justifications for each program, location, and resource requirement (both short-term and long-term).    The following table reflects the amounts provided by the Committee:    To maintain agency functions the Committee provides the requested amount for cost of living requirements.    Agricultural Quarantine Inspection.--The Committee includes an appropriation of  for this program, including  for interline activities in Hawaii.    Animal Health Monitoring and Surveillance.--The Committee recommendation includes an increase of  for APHIS for activities related to Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia. The recommendation continues funding for surveillance activities for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy.    The Committee directs that within the amount provided,  is provided for a cooperative agreement with the Wisconsin Livestock Identification Consortium. This project supports the national plan to establish an animal and livestock -hour traceback system. The Committee also provides  for the Farm Animal Identification and Records (FAIR) program. Both the Wisconsin consortium and the FAIR project should also be eligible to apply for cooperative agreement funding for animal identification, which is funded within the NAIS total. In addition, the Committee provides  for a database of North Carolina's agriculture industry for rapid response capabilities and  for the New Mexico Syndromic Validation Program to support early detection of pathogens in animals and prevent their spread. The Committee provides  for Iowa State University's work regarding risk assessments of genetically modified agricultural products.    Animal Identification.--Through fiscal year , a total of about  has been provided for a National Animal Identification System (NAIS). As of June , , APHIS had spent  to register about  percent of all premises; develop and maintain information technology; conduct outreach and education initiatives; and pay staff for developing and managing NAIS. Of the amount spent,  was made available to nonprofit livestock and poultry industry organizations to advance the development of NAIS through outreach and promotional efforts. In addition,  was spent on a third party study to clarify the costs and benefits of animal identification.    Until August , the Department had stated that program data would be held centrally; however, the Secretary announced in August that data would be held by private entities that meet certain requirements. In addition, after some signals from the Secretary that participation would be mandatory, the program is now voluntary. The NAIS implementation plan released in the spring of  included a timeline that called for the NAIS to be operational by  and fully implemented by . However, in November , APHIS released a Draft User Guide for NAIS, which states that the goal of premises registration is ``to establish a complete record of all locations, or premises, in the United States that manage or hold livestock and/or poultry''. According to USDA, because the program is voluntary and the goal can only be reached if producers choose to participate, a date is not specified as to when the goal is expected to be achieved. In addition, it is not clear if the program's original goal of -hour animal trace-back is still part of the plan.    The Committee requests a complete and detailed strategic plan for the program, including tangible outcomes, measurable goals, specific milestones, and necessary resources for the entire program. Until the Committee receives this plan, the Committee has no justification to continue funding for this program and therefore, the Committee recommendation includes no new funding.    Animal and Plant Health Regulatory Enforcement.--In addition to pay costs, the Committee recommendation includes an increase of  as requested for additional field investigators to ensure compliance with border and animal care regulations.    Emergency Management Systems.--In addition to pay costs, the Committee recommendation includes an increase of  of which  is for animal care in emergencies and  for the vaccine stockpile.    High Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI).--In addition to pay costs, the Committee recommendation includes an increase of  as requested for domestic and international surveillance, including live bird markets and wildlife. Since ,  has been provided to APHIS for HPAI work. The Committee requests a report by November , , on how these funds have been spent.    Pest Detection.--The Committee recommendation provides  for this program. Within that amount, the Committee provides  in funding to continue a cooperative agreement with the California County Pest Detection Augmentation Program.    Select Agents.--In addition to pay costs, the Committee recommendation includes an increase of  above the amount available in fiscal year  to continue addressing issues raised by the Office of Inspector General.    Brucellosis.--The Committee recommendation includes  for this program. Within this amount, the Committee provides  for the Greater Yellowstone Interagency Brucellosis Committee to eliminate brucellosis from wildlife in the Greater Yellowstone area.    Chronic Wasting Disease.--The Committee recommendation includes  for this program. Within this amount, the Committee directs that  shall go to the State of Wisconsin.    Cotton Pests.--The Committee recommendation includes the consolidation of the Boll Weevil and Pink Bollworm line items into a new Cotton Pests program, as requested. The total provided is  to address boll weevil, pink bollworm, and other cotton pests or diseases. This amount is  above the budget request.    Emerging Plant Pests.--The Committee expects the Secretary of Agriculture to continue to use the authority provided in this bill to transfer funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) for the arrest and eradication of animal and plant pests and diseases that threaten American agriculture. By providing funds in this account, the Committee is enhancing, but not replacing, the use of CCC funding for emergency outbreaks.    For emerging plant pests, the Committee includes  an increase of  above the amount available in fiscal year . The Committee provides the following increased amounts for eradication and control activities:  for Asian Long-horned Beetle;  for citrus pests and diseases;  for Glassy-winged Sharpshooter/Pierce's Disease;  for Potato Cyst Nematode;  for Emerald Ash Borer;  for Sudden Oak Death;  for Karnal Bunt; and  for other miscellaneous pests and diseases.    The Committee is concerned about the spread of the Emerald Ash Borer. The Committee recommendation more than doubles the amount available in  to help States with new outbreaks, such as Maryland, and States that are at risk, such as Wisconsin. While the Committee is encouraged that APHIS may have a new and less costly survey tool to use in , the Committee requests that APHIS submits a plan by September , , on how resources available in  will be spent and where activities will be conducted.    The Committee provides  for hydrilla eradication around Lake Gaston in Virginia, and expects APHIS to monitor the effectiveness of hydrilla eradication around Smith Mountain Lake in Virginia. The Committee also provides  for olive fruit fly activities in California.    The Committee encourages the Secretary to transfer funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) to ensure adequate funding is made available for the eradication of potato cyst nematode in Idaho.    Gypsy Moth.--The Committee recommendation includes  for this program. The Committee encourages APHIS to help eradicate gypsy moth in New Jersey and Maryland.    Johne's Disease.--The Committee recommendation provides a total of  an increase of  above the budget request to maintain the current Federal share of total program costs.    Low Pathogen Avian Influenza.--The Committee recommendation provides a total of  as requested in the budget. This is an increase of  above the amount available in fiscal year . Funds are provided for work with the live bird marketing system, the commercial industry and National Poultry Improvement Plan, and the National Veterinary Services Laboratories.    Within the total, the Committee provides  to the State of Connecticut for purposes related to indemnification and education for AI vaccinations. The Committee recognizes that the traditional response to a low pathogen avian influenza (LPAI) outbreak on a poultry farm is the depopulation of the affected livestock, and that the USDA provides financial assistance through an emergency indemnification program to cover the cost of depopulation. The Committee is concerned that this approach is costly and ineffective and encourages the state to use the funds to study the costs and benefits of alternative methods for responding to an outbreak on poultry farms, including vaccinations.    In addition,  for indemnities, which was provided in fiscal year , remains available to the program.    Noxious Weeds.--The Committee recommendation includes  for this program. Within this amount, the Committee provides  for the Nez Perce Bio-Control Center and  for the National Biodiversity Conservation Strategy.    Tuberculosis.--In addition to pay costs, the Committee recommendation includes an increase of  above the amount available in fiscal year  for work at major slaughter plants.    Wildlife Services Operations.--The Committee recommendation provides a total of  as requested in the budget. The Committee rejects APHIS's proposal to redirect funds within this line item.    The recommendation assumes the continuation of current cost share levels for cooperators. The Committee directs that, other than funding for the specific items noted in this report, the funds provided in the Wildlife Services Operations line item are available for general operations needs.    The Committee continues the fiscal year  funding level for aviation safety. Within the Aviation Safety activities, the Committee encourages APHIS to expand research work into what can be done to deter birds from the increasing number of wind turbine generators around the nation.    The Committee continues to provide  for wolf predation management in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan.    The Committee provides funding for the following projects:  for Beaver management in North Carolina;  for crop and aquaculture losses in southeast Missouri;  for predation wildlife services in Virginia;  for blackbird control in Louisiana;  for predator control programs in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming;  for brown tree snake management in Guam;  for Hawaii and Guam operations;  for cormorant control in New York;  for the Cooperative Livestock Protection Program in the State of Pennsylvania;  for beaver management control in Mississippi; and  for surveillance in North Dakota.    The Committee expects APHIS to use program funding to appropriately address rabies in Broward County, Florida. The Committee expects APHIS to continue monitoring Ohio and Michigan for cormorant control. The Committee also expects APHIS to continue funding wildlife services in Arkansas at the fiscal year  level. The Committee encourages APHIS to help resolve the damage and disease issues caused by non-native patas and rhesus monkeys in Puerto Rico.    Animal Welfare.--In addition to pay costs, the Committee recommendation includes an increase of  above the amount available in fiscal year  as requested. A total of  is provided for additional inspectors to further improve Animal Welfare Act enforcement. This responds to Animal Care's significantly increased workload as a result of rapid growth in the number of new licensees and registrants.    Biotechnology Regulatory Services (BRS).--The Committee is concerned with the gaps in oversight by USDA in this area. In December , a report from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) identified numerous holes in APHIS' regulatory efforts for genetically-engineered crops. APHIS should proceed carefully to ensure the safe development and use of genetically-engineered organisms. The Committee understands that the Office of Inspector General is finalizing an audit on this program and expects APHIS to address all concerns before additional funding can be provided.    Plant Methods Development Labs.--In addition to pay costs, the Committee recommendation includes an increase of  above the amount available in fiscal year  to support the development of detection and control tools to contain and eradicate the emerald ash borer.    Veterinary Biologics.--In addition to pay costs, the Committee recommendation includes an increase of  above the amount available in fiscal year . Of this amount,  is for meeting increased demands for veterinary biologics applications, and  is for addressing containment requirements and meeting standards related to the use of select agents and toxins.    Veterinary Diagnostics.--In addition to pay costs, the Committee recommendation includes an increase of  above the amount available in fiscal year  for highest priority needs.    Within the total for Veterinary Diagnostics, funding is provided for the following projects:  is provided for the Agricultural Biosecurity Center at Kansas State University;  for Agricultural Compliance Laboratory equipment in Delaware; and  for aquaculture monitoring technology at Kentucky State University.    Wildlife Services Methods Development.--In addition to pay costs, the Committee recommendation includes an increase of  above the amount available in fiscal year  as requested for the avian influenza initiative to study the virus in swine.    Within the total provided,  is included for the National Wildlife Research Station in Kingsville, Texas, to address emerging infectious disease issues associated with wildlife populations.    The Committee also includes  to continue the cooperative agreement between the Hawaii Agricultural Research Center and the National Wildlife Research Center in Hilo."

841,110-258 H.txt,    For Marketing Services of the Agricultural Marketing Service,"    For Marketing Services of the Agricultural Marketing Service, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and an increase of  above the budget request.    The Committee recommendation includes  for pay costs as requested. The recommendation also includes an increase of  as requested for activities relating to Organic Standards for a total of . The Committee encourages the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) to continue working with the Risk Management Agency to collect organic price data.    Country-of-Origin Labeling (COOL).--The Committee recommendation includes an increase of  for AMS to implement COOL requirements for all covered commodities. The Committee understands that AMS is finishing the rule for fish and shellfish and is drafting a rule for all other covered commodities.    The Committee notes that AMS recently issued notices re-opening the comment period for  days for the proposed rule on all covered commodities, except fish and shellfish, and the interim final rule on fish and shellfish covered commodities. The Committee directs AMS to meet the following timeline:    January , : Publish re-proposed rule for covered commodities with a -day comment period.    July , : Publish final rule for all covered commodities.    July , : Initiate Congressional review for final rule for all covered commodities.    September , : Effective date for final rule for all covered commodities.    A report should be sent to the Committee a week after each date outlining the status of each milestone, the reason the deadline was not met if appropriate, and a plan on how AMS will meet the September ,  deadline.    Microbiological Data Program (MDP).--The Committee recommendation does not include the proposed termination of MDP. It is continued at . In its proposal to terminate the program, AMS argued that it was difficult to determine the usefulness of the data. The Committee would like to work with AMS to implement this program as originally intended. A report should be submitted to the Committee by November , , outlining what AMS thinks are obstacles to meeting program goals and solutions to those obstacles. The report should also include recommendations on how this program can help the Food and Drug Administration in reducing foodborne illness incidences.    Audit-Based Programs.--The Committee is very interested in AMS' user-fee funded, voluntary programs that apply Good Manufacturing Practices, issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to the management of production and handling systems for fresh-cut fruit and vegetables. The Committee urges AMS to develop an aggressive marketing plan to increase participation in these programs. In addition, it is not clear if the audit results are used by FDA to complement their food safety activities. The Committee requests a report from AMS by January , , outlining a marketing campaign to enhance participation in these audit-based programs and a plan to provide useful information to FDA.    National Organic Program.--The Committee recommendation includes  as requested for the National Organic Program. This represents an increase of almost  percent over the amount available in .    The Committee continues to provide  in this account for the Farmers' Market Promotion Program to make grants to eligible entities for projects to establish, expand, and promote farmers' markets. The Committee directs that no entity should receive more than  in funding from the program, and requests a report on the grants made, including the entity, purpose, and location, and the administrative costs of the program by March , ."

843,110-258 H.txt,    For the Marketing Agreements and Orders Program,"    For the Marketing Agreements and Orders Program, the Committee provides a transfer from section  funds of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and the same amount as the budget request.    The Committee provides not less than  in funding for the Web-based Supply Chain Management System (WBSCM) in this account.    The Committee reiterates its position that administrative expenses to support section  purposes are expressly allowed, and that purchase and maintenance of a computer system supporting commodity purchases is an authorized administrative expense. Development and maintenance of all previous computer systems to support commodity purchase, including the existing Processed Commodity Inventory Management System (PCIMS), have been funded through section ."

845,110-258 H.txt,    For Grain Inspection,"    For Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA), the Committee provides  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year , and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The Committee is aware of the proposal for user fees in the President's budget, but does not recommend establishing such fees in annual appropriations acts and will consider such fees should they achieve authorization.    The recommendation includes an increase of  for increased enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act. GIPSA shall submit to the Committee no later than September ,  a detailed spending plan for resources available for enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act, including the recommended increase.    The Committee is seriously concerned about GIPSA's lack of oversight in the past on companies it is charged with regulating. The Packers and Stockyards (P&S) arm of GIPSA is charged with ensuring competitive, fair livestock, meat, and poultry markets. However, according to the agency, GIPSA has never conducted a financial audit of the large packers and has traditionally relied on the companies' auditors to ensure reported information is in compliance with the law. In addition, following a review of the P&S program in , the Office of Inspector General (OIG) found material weaknesses in the agency's ability to define and track investigations, plan and conduct investigations, and make policy, areas that are essential to GIPSA's ability to administer and enforce the P&S Act.    The Committee notes that this latest OIG review cites similar concerns raised by a previous OIG review in  and by the Government Accountability Office in . The Committee urges GIPSA to use all resources available to the agency to conduct vigorous government oversight to ensure markets are fair and competitive, and businesses are in compliance with the law."

The Committee is aware of the proposal for user fees in the President's budget, but does not recommend establishing such fees in annual appropriations acts and will consider such fees should they achieve authorization.    The Committee provides the full amounts requested related to pay costs and employee benefits, a total increase of . The Committee provides an increase of  as requested, for data systems for the Food Emergency Response Network (FERN), and an increase of  for lab equipment, as requested. The Committee provides an increase of  for filling vacancies in federal inspector positions. The Committee does not approve the proposed reduction of  in funding for the public health data communication infrastructure (PHDCI). Within the base resources provided is at least  for Humane Methods of Slaughter enforcement and at least  for the related tracking system.    The Committee does not approve the requested increase of  for seven additional FERN labs. While the Committee supports the goal of having adequate surge capacity for testing food in an emergency, it is troubled by the Department's abrupt change this year from its prior insistence that  labs were needed. It now says  labs are needed. This sudden change causes the Committee to question the analytical basis of this program. The Committee maintains funding for PHCDI and adds funding for food safety inspector vacancies. These funds are needed to improve the ability of FSIS to address current food safety needs.    Bonuses.--On September , , the Under Secretary for Food Safety advised the Committee that FSIS might end that fiscal year with a balance of only several hundred thousand dollars and that it was continuing to cut spending and maintain a hiring freeze for non-frontline positions. In light of this, the Committee was very disturbed to learn that FSIS spent nearly half a million dollars on bonuses for senior FSIS officials for that year. At least  people received bonuses of  or more, which equates to about half of the top starting salary for a slaughter inspector. The Committee directs FSIS to use its appropriated funds for activities directly in support of the public health to the maximum available extent before using them for bonus awards for senior officials. The Committee requests a report by January ,  on any bonuses awarded to senior officials for fiscal year .    Imported poultry products from China.--The Committee has included a general provision barring the use of funds in the bill to establish or implement any rule allowing poultry products from China into the U.S. This would apply to both the rule currently in effect that would allow poultry from the U.S. to be processed in China and shipped back and to a rule the Department is drafting that would allow China to export processed poultry products made from animals raised in China.    Given the recent situation involving pet foods contaminated with melamine from China and the repeated, serious food contamination incidents within China, it is clear that we cannot rely on the Chinese government to ensure its plants adhere to U.S. standards in processing. Weak government controls in China, coupled with the high incidence of HN in that country, provide no assurance that the returned product is actually from U.S. poultry or that poultry carrying the HN virus is not used instead of U.S.-produced poultry. While FSIS has said the products would be safe because processing would kill any HN viruses, U.S. inspectors will not be standing over the shoulders of Chinese workers; in fact, U.S. inspectors would visit the Chinese plants at most once a year.    Risk-based inspection proposal.--The Committee has also included the same general provision that was enacted in P.L. - to bar FSIS from proceeding with the risk-based inspection program it announced on February , , until the USDA Office of Inspector General (OIG) has provided its findings to the Food Safety and Inspection Service and the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate on the data used in support of the development and design of the riskbased inspection program and FSIS has addressed and resolved issues identified by OIG.    OIG has done  audits of FSIS since June  and has repeatedly found basic problems with how the agency conducts its operations. In just two of its most recent audits of FSIS, OIG found that:     From October  through June , FSIS had conducted only eight initial onsite reviews from a total of  State MPI programs.     A significant number of establishments were excluded from Salmonella testing due to ineffective processes for identifying establishments eligible for testing.    Given the many problems found by OIG in the past and FSIS' poor track record, the Committee believes the agency must not proceed even with a pilot program until there has been a thorough review of its proposal by OIG and until all issues raised by OIG have been addressed and resolved. The Committee includes this language to ensure that there is adequate time for OIG to complete its work and for FSIS to resolve any issues that are raised.    The Committee intends FSIS to continue activities related to ensuring that the program, if it goes forward, is based on scientifically justified information. Those activities should include an emphasis on such activities as data collection and public meetings and less emphasis on activities such as the recent negotiations with the meat inspectors union. The Committee recognizes that moving forward with the risk-based inspection program without comprehensive and accurate scientific data to rank product risk and an unbiased system for determining establishment risk would have the potential of jeopardizing public health.    Salmonella Verification Testing Program.--The purpose of the Salmonella Verification Testing Program is to provide FSIS with information about whether plants are controlling the level of Salmonella in their establishments. With this critical information, FSIS can then make informed regulatory decisions to further reduce pathogen contamination in meat and poultry products and improve food safety. After FSIS personnel collect, label and culture the Salmonella samples, an APHIS laboratory serotypes the positive Salmonella isolates, and then FSIS sends the isolates from raw meat and poultry products to an Agricultural Research Service Laboratory. After the ARS laboratory analyzes the samples further, it stores the information in databases. We understand the existing memorandum of understanding has lapsed and the agencies have been working on a replacement. The Committee directs the Food Safety and Inspection Service and the Agricultural Research Service to submit a report to the Committee by September ,  on the status of any memorandum of understanding between the two agencies regarding the access to the information housed in an ARS database on the salmonella isolates that were collected as a result of regulatory sampling by the Food Safety and Inspection Service.    Audit recommendations not achieving management decision within  days.--The Committee has received from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the record a list of audit reports where management decisions have not been achieved within  days. Included on the list were four audit reports for FSIS, with multiple open recommendations. The Committee supports OIG in its efforts to reach agreement within  days and directs FSIS to send the Committee a report by October ,  with a plan for reaching management decision on the outstanding issues."
849,110-258 H.txt,    For the Office of the Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services,"    For the Office of the Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The Committee notes that the budget request did not include estimates for implementing a new  Farm Bill. Testimony given by the Under Secretary during the hearing on the Farm and Foreign Agricultural Service budget stated that ``Once the parameters and details of the new bill are known, we will need to evaluate the necessary administrative resource requirements to implement the legislative programs and policies.'' The Committee expects the Department to work with the Committee on Agriculture to provide estimates of the implementation costs for inclusion in the  Farm Bill. The Committee directs the Department to submit reports to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and the agriculture authorizing committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate, within  days of passage of the House and Senate  Farm Bills, that detail the necessary administrative resource requirements to implement the bills, including information technology expenses.    The Committee notes that the Farm Service Agency (FSA) computer system that is responsible for processing payments for all Farm Bill programs administered by the Farm Service Agency has been experiencing periodic shutdowns due to capacity overloads, causing the efficiency of thousands of Farm Service Agency county office employees to decrease dramatically. The Committee is aware that a plan to upgrade this system is being developed by USDA. The Committee directs the Secretary to submit to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and the agriculture authorizing committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate a report that has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget and reviewed by the Government Accountability Office. The report shall include: () An enterprise architecture; () an Information Technology Human Capital Plan; () a capital investment plan for implementing the enterprise architecture; () a description of the information technology capital planning and investment control process; and () a spending plan. The spending plan shall include each specific project funded, key milestones, all funding sources for each project, details of annual and lifecycle costs, and projected savings or cost avoidance to be achieved by the project.    The Committee is extremely disappointed with the Department's efforts to date to upgrade the technological capabilities of the FSA's Field Office hardware and software infrastructure, including digital mapping and crop planning analysis. Although Congress has approved significant funding for these activities, structural and technological issues continue to persist and plague the Agency's operations both at the headquarters and field level, and have had a direct impact on the quality of service provided to FSA customers. Without an appropriate level of upgraded technological support, fully executing the planned system-wide reorganization of field offices would be premature until the Agency submits the requested report on the spending plan.    The Committee includes statutory language to delay the development and implementation of plans to close any local or county office of the Farm Service Agency. The Committee held a hearing on the Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services budget and the message from the Committee was quite clear, Farm Service offices should not be closed until the technological issues are resolved or at least a plan in place. Also, a new Farm Bill will be passed and the impact on the Farm Service Agency structure is unknown at this time. The Committee directs the Department to take no further action on closure of FSA offices until at least six months after the next Farm Bill is passed or expiration of the fiscal year  appropriations bill.    The Committee is very concerned about the continued decline in the number of small minority owned and operated farms nationwide. According to an Economic Research Service (ERS) report the percentage of non-white farms owned has dropped from % to %. The number of such farms has declined from , in  to , by . Therefore, the Committee directs the Department to develop a plan of action to stabilize and expand the number of small minority owned and operated farms, including a detailed strategy on how the Department plans to expand opportunities for these farmers to fully participate in all USDA's farm programs, as well as proactive measures to reach out to this important resource and report its findings to the Committee by March , .    Audit recommendations not achieving management decision within  days.--The Committee has received from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the record a list of audit reports where management decisions have not been achieved within  days. Included on the list were two audit reports for FSA, with multiple open recommendations. The Committee supports OIG in its efforts to reach agreement within  days and directs FSA to send the Committee a report by October ,  with a plan for reaching management decision on the outstanding issues."
850,110-258 H.txt,    For Salaries and Expenses of the Farm Service Agency (FSA),"    For Salaries and Expenses of the Farm Service Agency (FSA), the Committee provides an appropriation of  and transfers from other accounts of  for a total program level of . This is an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The Committee recommendation includes an additional  for pay costs,  for activities previously funded through the Department's CCE account, and  for operating expenses.    The Committee provides to the Administrator of the Farm Service Agency,  the same as the fiscal year  level, for the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP). This amount is in addition to any provided by cooperating funds from any other federal, state, or local government funding for NAIP.    The Committee is concerned by the large increases requested for FSA salaries and expenses. The FSA salaries and expense request represented over eight percent of the total budget request. FSA has received about a thirty percent increase in the salaries and expense account since fiscal year . Included in the requested increase was  to restore funding for activities that were funded by balances carried over from fiscal year  into fiscal year . Any funds that are unspent from prior years and carried forward should not be considered as part of the base budget. Agencies were expected to manage within the funds provided within the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, .    The Committee is also concerned by the amount FSA spends on IT operations. In fiscal year , FSA is estimated to spend over  for the costs of maintaining and operating FSA IT systems and the budget request includes an additional  in fiscal year . Beginning last autumn, FSA began experiencing outages of service for some of its web-based applications that support certain farm programs. The supplemental included an additional  for network and database/application stabilization to address immediate needs identified by the Department to address the outage issues. The Committee directs the Secretary to provide a monthly update to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate on the progress of this project, including usage of funds. In addition, the Committee has been hearing for several years that FSA needs to modernize its IT system but a modernization plan has yet to be submitted. The budget request does not include reference to the FSA modernization issues but it is estimated the lifecycle cost is in the range of  to  over a  year time period. The Committee plans to have rigorous oversight of the current and projected IT spending within FSA.    The Committee notes that FSA is also using over  of the funds provided for NAIP for stabilization of the computer network. The Committee is concerned that additional resources above the amount identified by the Department for stabilization have been diverted from NAIP for this project.    The Committee expects FSA to improve communication with the Risk Management Agency to prevent duplicative payments. The Committee directs FSA to use all possible means to avoid duplicative payments, including data mining."

855,110-258 H.txt,    For the Risk Management Agency,"    For the Risk Management Agency, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The Committee has serious concerns about the ability of the Risk Management Agency (RMA) to prevent abuses in the crop insurance program. Therefore, the Committee has included a general provision to allow the use of up to  in mandatory funds to improve the Department's ability to police the program for waste, fraud and abuse. The funding made available would be used for maintaining and upgrading data-mining and supporting business applications and hardware used to detect and deter suspect claims and for the continuation of development of the Comprehensive Information and Management System (CIMS). CIMS is a joint information management system for RMA and the Farm Service Agency that will assist in identification of discrepancies between reports on participation in both programs to detect potential waste fraud and abuse.    In addition, the Committee has provided an increase of  for the USDA Office of Inspector General for continued work on waste, fraud and abuse issues related to crop insurance and farm payments.    The Committee believes that the administration must come forward with a plan--and the budgetary resources needed--to address aggressively the problems of waste, fraud and abuse in the crop insurance program that have been identified by OIG and the Government Accountability Office. The Committee directs the Secretary to submit such a plan to the Committee by February , .    Audit recommendations not achieving management decision within  days.--The Committee has received from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the record a list of audit reports where management decisions have not been achieved within  days. Included on the list were three audit reports for RMA, with a number of open recommendations.

The Committee is concerned about the proposal to close local Rural Development (RD) offices. Some of these offices are located in counties identified by the Economic Research Service as persistent poverty counties. The Committee includes a general provision that requires the Secretary of Agriculture to determine the cost effectiveness and enhancement of program delivery prior to closing or relocating any Rural Development offices. The Committee directs the Department to provide a report, not later than  days before the date of the proposed closure or relocation, which describes in detail the justifications for such closures and relocation.    While the Committee is providing a significant increase in both loans and grants for renewable energy projects it directs the Department to review the current project eligibility and financial criteria and revise them as appropriate to ensure that projects funded will in fact lead to a significant reduction in traditional sources of energy, especially fossil fuels, and will have sufficient economic return on the investment to repay loans and employ proven technologies that yield significant environmental benefits. To that end the Committee directs the Department to include specific, discrete, measurable performance measures in each grant or loan provided under this heading for a renewable energy project and to subsequently measure the results against those performance measures.

868,110-258 H.txt,    For the Rural Community Advancement Program,"    For the Rural Community Advancement Program, the Committee provides an appropriation of  a decrease of  below the amount available for fiscal year  and an increase of  above the budget request.    The budget request included a proposal to fund the three funding streams under the Rural Community Advancement Program (RCAP) (rural utilities programs, rural community programs, and rural business and cooperative development programs) in separate accounts, and eliminate the central RCAP account. While the Committee is intrigued by this proposal and believes it may have merit, enactment of the  Farm Bill may impact these programs. Thus, the Committee intends to work with the Department to review the proposal carefully within the context of the enacted Farm Bill. For comparative purposes, the tables reflected within this account will show the three funding streams within RCAP.    The following table provides the Committee's recommendations as compared to the budget request:"

870,110-258 H.txt,    For the Rural Housing Insurance Fund program account,"    For the Rural Housing Insurance Fund program account, the Committee provides a loan level of  an increase of  above the amount available in fiscal year  and an increase of  above the budget request.    The following table reflects the loan levels for the Rural Housing Insurance Fund program account:"
871,110-258 H.txt,    For the Rental Assistance Program,"    For the Rental Assistance Program, the Committee provides a program level of  a decrease of  below the amount available in fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    These funds will be used for renewal of expiring rental assistance contracts for a one-year term and provides funding for preservation incentives and new construction contracts. In addition, this funding level provides a two-month funding reserve to cover any unforeseen disruptions for renewing contracts. This one-year agreement term will minimize the cost fluctuations in this account.    The Committee notes that the cost to provide renewal of expiring rental assistance contracts for a two-year term would be  an increase of  above the budget request and  over the amount available in fiscal year . Since the budget request proposed eliminating many critical Rural Development loan and grant programs, the Committee was not able to provide the additional resources that would be required to maintain the rental assistance program for a two-year contract term. Also, the budget request assumed that funding for fiscal year  would be based on one-year contract renewals but the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, , provided funding for two-year contract renewals. This change in the fiscal year  assumption decreases the funding necessary to provide for one-year contract renewals in fiscal year ."

The Committee provided funding for the multi-family housing demonstration revolving fund in the Multifamily Housing Revitalization Program Account. The Committee also did not provide funding in this account for the supervisory and technical assistance grant program and the compensation for construction defects programs since the programs are expected to have carryover balances that will be used to fund the programs."

The Committee is concerned by the Department's administration of the broadband loan program. Since the inception of the loan program, the Department has failed to obligate available resources to fund viable broadband projects. In fiscal year ,  was carried over from fiscal year , providing a total of  in budget authority and a program level of . Historically, the Department does not obligate the current year appropriation for this program and it is estimated that the  provided in fiscal year  will carry over into fiscal year . This carry over will provide an additional program level of  for a total program level of  in fiscal year . The Committee is aware that the Rural Utilities Service has published a proposed rule to address critical program issues. The Committee believes the appropriation for the broadband loan program is sufficient to meet expected demand in fiscal year , with the expected carryover of prior year funds, and implementation of a new rule and the Farm Bill.    The Committee notes the proposed rule proposes to place limitations on service to high density areas which are likely to have broadband service. The Committee expects the Department to prioritize deployment of Broadband Service to households with no or limited broadband access."
883,110-258 H.txt,    For the Office of the Under Secretary for Food,"    For the Office of the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount provided in fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The Committee is aware that the State of Indiana has recently entered into a contract to privatize certain operations of the Food Stamp Program. It is the Committee's understanding that USDA approved the contract in December  without a clear understanding of the details of the program, including its implementation, effect on state employees, daily operation of the program or even whether the program complied with federal law. In February , USDA sent a letter to the State of Indiana requesting additional details about the program, with only weeks to go before the initial transfer to private contractors of about  percent of state employees working on the Food Stamp Program; this had already been scheduled to occur on March , . Therefore, the Committee directs the Secretary to perform comprehensive oversight of the program. It further directs the Secretary to provide the Committee with quarterly reports beginning  days after passage of this bill on this contract, including the effects on enrollment, program access, error rates, and spending on administrative expenses. The Committee directs the Secretary to be prepared to take appropriate administrative action if performance standards as stated in the contract are not met.    The Committee recognizes that the Food and Nutrition Service is promoting the Healthier U.S. School Challenge as part of the President's Healthier U.S. Initiative, and the Committee commends the USDA for participating in this initiative. The Committee notes that there are school-based physical education programs, such as PELife, that are getting positive measurable outcomes in student fitness, as well as reduced disciplinary incidences. The Committee strongly encourages the Food and Nutrition Service to explore collaboration between nutrition programming and wellness, and such school-based physical education programs.    The Committee believes that when a school food service authority contracts with a foodservice management company for the provision of meals it is important to ensure the integrity of accounting functions. The Committee believes that when allowing a food service management company to control, either directly or indirectly, point-of-sale software as well as the editing or reformatting of transactional data used to support the federal reimbursement claim, school food service authorities must exercise sufficient oversight, as required in regulation to protect the integrity of the school meal program. The Committee requests the Government Accountability Office to provide a report, no later than February , , on the nature and effectiveness of internal control procedures to ensure the accuracy of meal counting and claiming by Food Service Management companies under contract to provide meal service to School Districts participating in the National School Lunch Program. In particular, the Committee is interested in such procedures established by Food Service Management companies themselves as well as those procedures undertaken by School Districts in their oversight and monitoring of contractual performance.    Audit recommendations not achieving management decision within  days.--The Committee has received from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the record a list of audit reports where management decisions have not been achieved within  days. Included on the list were three audit reports for FNS, with several open recommendations. The Committee supports OIG in its efforts to reach agreement within  days and directs FNS to send the Committee a report by October ,  with a plan for reaching management decision on the outstanding issues."
884,110-258 H.txt,    For the Child Nutrition Programs,"    For the Child Nutrition Programs, the Committee provides a total of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and an increase of  above the budget request. Of the total amount provided,  is by direct appropriation and  is by transfer from Section .    The Committee includes a general provision to expand the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program to all States. The Committee provides up to  for each State, not currently authorized, to carry out a program to make free fresh fruits and vegetables available to elementary or secondary schools to make available to students throughout the school day.    The Committee also includes a general provision to expand the Simplified Summer Food Program to all States.    The Committee notes the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of  authorized a pilot study on eliminating the reduced price school meal program, subject to the availability of funds. Eliminating reduced price meals nationwide by increasing the limit for free meals to  percent of poverty, would cost  over five years. A pilot study for forecasting the impact of eliminating the reduced price school meal program would require a demonstration with comparison sites and an evaluation that looked at participation increases, rates and how ``error demographics'' and administrative challenges were different between the demonstration sites and the comparison sites. A pilot program would take three years, two years to collect the data and one year to evaluate the program. Since the Child Nutrition Programs will be reauthorized in , there is not time to initiate a pilot program before the program is reauthorized.    The following table reflects the Committee recommendations for the child nutrition programs:"
885,110-258 H.txt,    For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,"    For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and an increase of  above the budget request.    The Committee notes that since the budget request was submitted last February, estimates for participation and food costs have increased for fiscal year  and fiscal year , increasing the estimate for program needs in fiscal year .    USDA has reported large upward revisions to its dairy price forecasts, and WIC food costs for fiscal year  are starting to reflect this increase. Since milk and cheese account for about  percent of WIC food costs, large fluctuations in dairy prices have a significant impact on WIC food costs. The increased WIC food costs in fiscal year  reduce the projected carry-over into fiscal year . Also, participation in fiscal year  has been somewhat higher than originally estimated, which increases the estimated participation for fiscal year .    Also, it is currently estimated the WIC program will have an unobligated balance in the contingency reserve of about  which is  above the original appropriation of  provided for the reserve. The Committee includes a general provision to rescind the  from the contingency fund and includes this amount in this record level WIC grant funds.    The Committee does not include the requested increase of  in the contingency fund. The contingency fund is intended to support participation should cost or participation exceed budget estimates. The Committee instead includes an additional  for WIC grants to States to address the estimated increases in participation and food costs in fiscal year .    The Committee does not include the provision as requested in the President's budget, that caps the national average participant grant for nutrition services and administration (NSA) grants to States at . for fiscal year , increasing the estimate for NSA funding by .    Therefore, the recommended funding level,  above the budget request and  above the amount provided in fiscal year , is currently estimated to be sufficient to meet program needs. However, the Committee is aware that dairy prices are continuing to rise and will continue to monitor WIC food costs, participation, and carry-over funds, and take additional action as necessary to ensure that funding provided in fiscal year  is sufficient to serve all eligible applicants.    The recommended funding level includes  for continuation of the breastfeeding peer counselor program.    The Committee provides  for investments in management information systems, if the Secretary determines that those funds are not needed to maintain caseload and will not require use of the contingency fund.    The Committee does not include language requested by the Administration that provides guidance that funds under this heading shall not be used for WIC benefits for individuals who receive medical assistance or whose family member is a pregnant woman or infant who receives assistance, unless their family falls below  percent of the applicable poverty guidelines.    Electronic Benefit Transfer.--The Committee recommendation includes language to allow funds to be used for WIC electronic benefit transfer (EBT) systems and sets the authorized level of infrastructure funding at  which includes funding to develop EBT systems."
886,110-258 H.txt,    For the Food Stamp Program,"    For the Food Stamp Program, the Committee provides  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request. The total amount includes  for a contingency reserve in fiscal year  and  for the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP).    The Committee does not include the provision, requested in the President's budget, which provides funding as a monthly transitional benefit to Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) participants. The Committee does not provide the funding requested in the President's budget for the CSFP transitional benefit or CSFP outreach grants. The Committee provided an appropriation for the CSFP in the Commodity Assistance Program.    The Committee includes statutory language to exclude special pay for military personnel deployed to designated combat areas when determining food stamp eligibility.    The following table reflects the Committee recommendations for the food stamp program:"
887,110-258 H.txt,    The Committee provides an appropriation of  for the Commodity Assistance Program,"    The Committee provides an appropriation of  for the Commodity Assistance Program, an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and an increase of  above the budget request.    The recommended funding level for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) is  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and an increase of  above the budget request.    The Committee provides a large increase for the CSFP with the expectation that the fiscal year  caseload will be maintained. Of this increase, the Committee provides at least  to begin funding the five states with USDA approved plans. Within the remaining available funds, the Committee directs the Department to provide additional caseload in the states with existing programs and documented additional needs. In assigning additional caseload, the Committee directs the Department to give priority to those states which received supplemental caseload in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and Pandemic Influenza Act of , and continue to have demand for supplemental caseload.    The Committee is aware that of the funding made available for CSFP and TEFAP under Division B of P.L. -, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and Pandemic Influenza, , a small amount of resources remain available. These resources are in the form of both cash balances and commodity inventories. Given that disaster-related program operations have ceased, the Committee has included a general provision to allow these remaining resources, and any subsequent recoveries and collections, to be used to support the normal on-going operations of CSFP and TEFAP.    The Committee has included  for administration of TEFAP, an increase of  above the amount available in fiscal year  and an increase of  above the budget request. These funds may be used for administration purposes or for food costs at the discretion of the States. In addition, the Committee recommendation includes language that allows the Secretary to transfer up to  of TEFAP commodity funding to processing, storage, and distribution costs.    For the Food Donations Programs the Committee provides an appropriation of  for Pacific Island Assistance, the same as the amount available for fiscal year  and the same as the budget request.    Farmers' Market Nutrition Program.--The Committee recommendation includes  for the Farmers' Market Nutrition Program, an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and an increase of  above the budget request.    Seniors Farmers' Market Program.--Public Law -, Section , directs mandatory funding for this program from funds available to the Commodity Credit Corporation through fiscal year . This program is scheduled for reauthorization in fiscal year ."
888,110-258 H.txt,    For Nutrition Programs Administration,"    For Nutrition Programs Administration, the Committee has provided  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The Committee recommendation includes an increase of  to fund initiatives by the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion to continue development of an evidence-based system for the  Dietary Guidelines for Americans and enhancements to MyPyramid interactive applications and information technology services."
889,110-258 H.txt,    For the Foreign Agricultural Service,"    For the Foreign Agricultural Service, the Committee provides an appropriation of  and transfers of  for a total salaries and expenses level of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The Committee recommendation includes  for pay costs as requested. Unlike many other agencies, the Foreign Agricultural Service received an increase in the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, . The Committee believes that there are sufficient resources in base funding for overseas operations and reimbursements to the Department of State.    Audit recommendations not achieving management decision within  days.--The Committee has received from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the record a list of audit reports where management decisions have not been achieved within  days. Included on the list was one audit report for FAS, with one open recommendation. The Committee supports OIG in its efforts to reach agreement within  days and directs FAS to send the Committee a report by October ,  with a plan for reaching management decision on the outstanding issue.    The Committee recommendation includes the fiscal year  funding level for technical assistance for the promotion of specialty crop experts."

893,110-258 H.txt,    The Committee provides an appropriation of  in budget authority,"    The Committee provides an appropriation of  in budget authority, an increase of  above the amount available in fiscal year , and an increase of  above the budget request. In addition, the Committee makes available  in animal drug user fees for total Salaries and Expenses of .    The Committee provides budget authority as follows:  for the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) and related field activities of the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA);  for the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and related field activities of ORA;  for the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and related field activities of ORA;  for the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) and related field activities of ORA;  for the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and related field activities of ORA;  for the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR);  for headquarters and the Office of the Commissioner;  for GSA rental payments;  for other rent and rent-related activities; and  for White Oak consolidation expenses.    In addition, the Committee also provides increases of  for the Office of Generic Drugs,  for the Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising and Communication,  for the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology,  for the Office of Cosmetics and Colors, and  for CFSAN. In addition, the Committee provides a total of  for the Office of Women's Health.    The Committee notes that this bill, if enacted, would be the second straight large increase in funding provided for FDA. If this bill were enacted, FDA would receive an increase of almost  in discretionary budget authority compared to the  enacted bill.    The Committee does not make available prescription drug and medical device user fees, as the reauthorizations for those fees for fiscal year  have not yet been enacted. However, if those fees are reauthorized at the levels estimated in the budget, total resources for FDA will exceed  in fiscal year .    Pending further review, the Committee does not provide any funds for closure of FDA laboratory facilities.    The Committee does not approve the proposed reduction in the Food Contact Notification Program. The Committee provides funding as requested for the National Center for Food Safety and Technology and for New Mexico State University. The Committee does not provide funding for the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Commission, the Warehousing Education and Research Council, the Natural Products Center, or the Critical Path Institute.    Bill structure.--Although the budget requested a statutory ``blank check'' that would remove the specified levels of funding for each center and other activities in the bill, the Committee believes the agency needs more budget controls, not fewer. Therefore, it has maintained the usual bill language structure.    Food safety.--The Committee believes that FDA is failing to do what is needed to ensure the safety of our food supply.    The Committee believes that additional budgetary resources must be tied to a sound management plan that represents a systemic approach to addressing the shortfalls of the inspection of our domestic and imported foods and that has the support of the Administration.    There have been mixed signs as to whether FDA is going to produce such a plan. To ensure that it does, the Committee directs FDA to develop a performance plan that establishes measurable benchmarks for concrete improvements in the performance of its food safety mission.    The plan must set forth clear, definitive goals over a multiyear period to comprehensively overhaul FDA's food safety operations, covering both domestic and imported foods. The plan must include a detailed description of any organizational, managerial, statutory and regulatory changes necessary to achieve them, as well as an assessment of the budgetary resources needed. If statutory changes are proposed, the plan must include the statutory language. The plan must be approved by the Office of Management and Budget.    The Committee suggests that enforceable standards for food safety, HAACP-like systems, and a process for reviewing the food safety systems in countries that export food to the United States should be considered as key parts of the building blocks of a stronger food safety system. These are proposals that are not dissimilar to measures FDA has proposed in the past or may be considering currently.    The Committee provides  to be available on July ,  for implementation of the plan. In order to have sufficient time to evaluate the plan, the Committee directs that it be transmitted concurrently with the fiscal year  budget.    While there are clearly shortfalls in FDA's approach to the safety of the other products it regulates, the Committee believes that it is appropriate to begin the process of overhauling FDA with the foods program, since the pending reauthorizations for the drug and medical device programs may make fundamental changes in those areas.    The Committee provides an additional  for increased activities to protect the safety of imported foods.    Field activities.--The Committee believes that it must hold FDA accountable for its performance of its field operations, which are the most basic activities FDA performs to protect the public health. Therefore, within the sums provided in this bill, the Committee provides  in budget authority for ORA for field activities by center as follows: CFSAN, ; CDER, ; CBER, ; CVM, ; and CDRH, . The Committee directs FDA to maintain at least these levels for field activities and to notify the Committee if it proposes to reduce any of them.    Direct to consumer advertising user fees.--In its recommendations for reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the Administration has proposed that FDA be permitted to charge drug companies a user fee for advisory reviews of their prescription drug direct-to-consumer (DTC) television ads. FDA's justification was, in part, that ``these television advertisements are highly visible and if done well, will reflect positively on the [drug] industry as a whole...''    Positive impacts on an industry should not be any part of FDA's considerations. DTC ads are designed to affect consumers and FDA's reviews of them should protect their interests. Having drug companies pay for the review of such ads--and having reviewers' salaries dependent on drug company fees--will further undermine the public's confidence in FDA.    The Committee believes the Administration's proposal to establish a user fee for review of direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising is ill-conceived. The Committee provides an increase of  for review of direct to consumer advertisements, the amount that FDA estimates would be raised by the proposed user fee. Should the DTC user fee proposal be authorized, the Committee will not approve an appropriation to make the funds collected available.    Postmarketing studies.--In June , the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) issued a report entitled ``FDA's Monitoring of Postmarketing Study Commitments.'' OIG looked at FDA's database of postmarketing study commitments (PMCs) for drugs approved between  and  and concluded that ``FDA cannot readily identify whether or how timely PMCs are progressing toward completion'' because many reports were missing or incomplete or contained information that was of little use to FDA. Many reports included none of the milestones towards completion required by the agency's regulations or only partial information.    The Committee is very concerned that FDA rejected OIG's recommendation that it tell companies to provide additional useful information in the annual status reports they submit to FDA, such as milestones to monitor progress in completing studies, merely because FDA would be required to change its regulations to do so.    The Committee cannot accept FDA's reason for not implementing this recommendation and directs FDA to submit a report by November ,  explaining why it believes it should not comply with this recommendation.    Office of Women's Health.--The Committee believes that the work of the Office of Women's Health at FDA is critical to ensuring that the wide ranging policies and actions at the agency reflect the health needs of women, and include research, outreach, and analyses of data by demographic variables, including race and ethnicity. The Committee provides  for the Office of Women's Health. The Committee requests quarterly reports on the expenditures and staffing levels of the Office to ensure that the resources provided are used exclusively for that Office.    Ketek.--The Committee is very concerned about criticisms of FDA's handling of clinical safety issues involving the drug Ketek.    FDA told the Committee that it ``will use the knowledge we have learned from the Ketek investigation to look at future studies and sites that we target for data audits.''    The Committee requests a report from the agency by October , , describing what FDA learned from the Ketek investigation.    Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy.--The Committee remains concerned over the prolonged delay in the issuance of a new, upgraded rule regarding the prohibition of additional specified risk materials from ruminant and non-ruminant animal feed. Within  days of enactment of this Act, FDA is directed to submit a report to the Committee detailing the obstacles to the completion of this report, as well as any legislative activity that would assist in the resolution of this issue.    Diacetyl.--The Committee is concerned about potential health hazards posed by exposure to the chemical diacetyl, a butter flavoring agent used in microwave popcorns and other foods. Although, FDA codified diacetyl as ``generally regarded as safe'' (GRAS) in , several recent investigations by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) found diacetyl to have caused a rare and fatal lung disease (bronchiolitis obliterans). The Committee believes that the more recent safety information by NIOSH comprises compelling scientific evidence that diacetyl may not only pose a real threat to exposed workers, but also raises the possibility of harm to consumers of microwave popcorn. The Committee believes that this matter warrants reconsideration by the FDA of the GRAS status of diacetyl, but at minimum, the FDA should conduct further studies to examine the safety of diacetyl and the relationship between exposure to the chemical and consumption of food products containing the butter flavoring. The Committee directs that FDA submit a report on its plan to research this issue further to the House Committee on Appropriations within  days of enactment.    Microbial Resistance.--In , FDA released guidance for industry that outlines a comprehensive, evidence-based approach to preventing antimicrobial resistance in humans that may result from the use of antimicrobial drugs in animals. However, the Committee is concerned that the guidance document does not assign enough weight to the impact of microbial resistance to drugs that are highly important to human medicine but are not used to treat foodborne illnesses. Transferred resistance from antimicrobials used in animals produced for food can also render critically important human antibiotics ineffective, including those used to treat foodborne illnesses. The Committee is concerned that simply satisfying the requirements of the guidance document is not adequate to protect human health. Therefore, the Committee directs FDA to reevaluate the basis on which it makes such decisions and to provide a report to the Committee by November , .    FDA enforcement.--FDA recently issued an import alert about certain types of farm-raised fish from China. The Committee is dismayed that it took the agency so long to act. FDA's own time-line on this issue indicates that concerns about this problem go back more than five years. The Committee expects FDA to act promptly to address violations of law and will monitor FDA's actions accordingly. The Committee will be examining this issue further this year.    The Committee is aware that the FDA issued a monograph for sunscreen products in , and the monograph was stayed shortly thereafter so that FDA could address the issue of measuring protection against UVA rays, which cause skin cancer. The Committee is disappointed that FDA has taken no further action, although skin cancer rates continue to rise, especially among young people and women. The Committee believes that a comprehensive monograph is essential to helping consumers make informed choices about protecting themselves against sun exposure. Therefore, the Committee directs FDA to issue a comprehensive monograph for over-the-counter sunscreen products, including UVA and UVB labeling requirements, within three months of enactment of this Act.    The Committee is deeply concerned about the dangers of Salmonella, especially in highly susceptible populations like young children, pregnant women, individuals over , post operative patients, or individuals with compromised immune systems. The Committee recommends that the FDA encourage any facility that serves highly susceptible populations, including schools, hospitals, nursing homes, acute care facilities, day care centers, and hospice facilities to consider using eggs that have been pasteurized to destroy all viable salmonellae.    The Committee is concerned that the FDA has still not finished its review of the safety for people of the subtherapeutic use of penicillin in animal feed and, accordingly, directs FDA to finish this review and make the review public by June , .    The conference report for fiscal year  suggested that FDA review the implementation of new operating procedures in the Los Angeles district with regard to importers of ethnic foods. Last year, in response to questions from the Committee, FDA indicated that they have implemented several actions to improve the processing of food import entries. The Committee encourages FDA to consider establishing a formal process for tracking status inquiries.    The Committee requests FDA to submit a report to the Committee on the implementation of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of  within  days of the date of enactment.    Responsiveness to Inspector General recommendations.--The Committee directs the agency to submit a report by October ,  on the status of all open audits and recommendations by OIG. The report must also include a plan for getting to resolution on all these open issues.    Responsiveness to GAO recommendations.--The Government Accountability Office (GAO) maintains on its website a list of open recommendations from its review work. Currently, the GAO lists numerous reports with open recommendations involving FDA. The Committee directs FDA to report to the Committee by October ,  on the status of all open GAO recommendations and on its plan to reach closure on each of them.    High-Risk List.--In addition, the Committee directs FDA and USDA to work with GAO on a plan whose implementation would result in food safety being removed from GAO's High-Risk List and to submit a report on that plan to the Committee by October , ."

Explanatory Notes.--The Committee appreciates receiving the detailed information provided in the Explanatory Notes prepared by the Department and relies heavily on this information when considering budget proposals. For fiscal year  and future years, the Department is directed to present Explanatory Notes in a format consistent with the presentation used for the fiscal year  Budget. The Explanatory Notes should also be assembled putting the accounts in the same order as the accounts in the bill. Any deviations from that format are to be approved in advance by the Committee.    State Office Collocation.--The Committee continues to direct that any reallocation of resources related to the collocation of state offices scheduled for  and subsequent years is subject to the Committee's reprogramming procedures.    Administrative Provision.--The Committee directs the Secretary to advise the Committees on Appropriations in writing of the status of all reports requested of the Department in this bill, at the time of submission of the fiscal year  budget and quarterly thereafter.    The Committee further directs that the dates established for the receipt of reports requested by the Committee herein are firm and that submission of reports is not to be delayed pending completion of the conference on this bill.    The Committee reminds the Secretary that all correspondence related to the directives in this bill must be addressed to the Committee on Appropriations.    Loan and Grant Programs.--The Committee is concerned by the lack of timely information on the unprecedented demand for the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund programs and the loan programs running out of funding half way through the fiscal year. The Committee directs the Department to provide quarterly reports to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate on the status of obligations and funds availability for the loan and grant programs provided in this bill. The Committee further directs the Department to notify the Committees if a program is experiencing unprecedented demand and is expected to run out of funds before the end of the fiscal year.    On May ,  the Environmental Protection Agency published a proposed rule ( CFR Part , [EPA-HQ-OAR--; FRL--]) proposing changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard Program. The rule includes new definitions and criteria for both renewable fuels and the feedstocks used to produce them, including new greenhouse gas emission thresholds for renewable fuels. For the first time in a regulatory program, an assessment of greenhouse gas emission performance is being utilized to establish those fuels that qualify for the four different renewable fuel standards. The greenhouse gas emission assessment evaluates the full lifecycle emission impacts of fuel production including both direct and indirect emissions, including significant emissions from land use changes.    EPA's modeling of indirect land use changes has not been published nor has it been peer reviewed. The Committee recognizes that this controversial type of modeling and analysis may have misstated the impact of indirect land. The Committee directs the Secretary of Agriculture through the Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service, in conjunction with the Office of the Chief Economist, to do an independent study of significant indirect land use changes for renewable fuels and the feedstocks used to produce them."

The Committee provides the increased funds to improve the Department's information technology security by conducting network security assessments, procuring and deploying security tools, and establishing the Agriculture Security Operations Center to monitor and protect USDA's systems.    In addition to the funding within OCIO, the Committee notes that the budget requested increased funding to centralize critical information technology systems in other agencies, including the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS). The Committee's recommended funding level takes into account the overlapping increases provided in these accounts for this initiative. The Committee expects that FSIS and FAS will coordinate and cooperate with OCIO in a timely manner to deploy these critical security improvements.    The Committee directs OCIO to provide a summary report by December , , that updates the Committee on the status of this network security initiative."
905,111-181 H.txt,    For the Office of the Chief Financial Officer,"    For the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The Committee directs the Department to submit a report concurrent with the Department's annual budget submission for the following fiscal year, updating the Committee on its contracting out policies, including agency budgets for contracting out, for fiscal years  and . The Committee is continuing bill language requiring the submission of the report on contracting out policies and agency budgets, prior to use of any funds appropriated to the Office of the Chief Financial Officer for FAIR Act or Circular A- activities.    Assessments.--As with charges for electronic government initiatives, the assessments that the Department charges its agencies for other government- and department-wide activities continue to escalate. Since these assessments are borne by the agencies, and Congress did not specifically provide increases to the agencies for these costs, most of the funding for the increase has come at the expense of programs. The Committee continues to direct the Office of the Chief Financial Officer to scrutinize the need for each activity, excluding electronic government initiatives; to consider its benefit to the mission of each agency; and to limit spending wherever possible."

Electronic Benefit Transfer.--The Committee recommendation includes language to allow funds to be used for WIC electronic benefit transfer (EBT) systems and sets the authorized level of infrastructure funding at  which includes funding to develop EBT systems.    The Committee recommendation also includes  for WIC reauthorization and program improvements to be used for increasing fruit and vegetable vouchers up to the Institute of Medicine recommendation, providing continued support for management information system projects, to move States toward implementation of electronic benefit transfer systems, and for an expanded breastfeeding peer counseling program.    The Committee urges the Department to use the WIC program to participate in targeted forms of early intervention. The Committee recommends cooperative partnerships, which would allow for prevention and wellness screening services to be offered concurrent with WIC services, provided the cost of these additional services including the associated administrative costs are reimbursed to the program. Currently participants of the WIC program are screened for anemia. The simple addition of a glucose test at the expanded screenings would lead to the early intervention necessary to keep obesity and diabetes levels low, and the Committee encourages the agency to participate in these type of ventures."

From funds provided for the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, the Committee provides an increase over fiscal year  of  for the Office of Generic Drugs.    The discretionary budget authority provided in this bill will allow FDA to increase staffing, including staffing devoted to inspections and other field activities, and will make real improvements in FDA's work to ensure the safety of foods and medical products. For example, in the foods area, FDA will be able to conduct  more foreign and domestic food inspections and do , more examinations of imported food products; in the medical products area, FDA will conduct  more examinations of imported drug products and  more examinations of imported medical device products. FDA will also be able to update its labs with new equipment that will allow it to do faster analyses of samples. The investments in this bill will also reap benefits in the next several years, when new inspectors hired with funds in this bill are fully trained, bringing significantly more domestic and foreign inspections and import field exams.    Other activities funded by the increases in the bill include such things as research in areas such as Salmonella and E. coli biomarkers and new methods of rapid detection of contamination; improved ability to collect and analyze data on foodborne illnesses; work on new screening tests for bloodborne diseases; enhanced efforts to understand adverse events related to medical devices used in pediatric hospitals; and evaluations of how the recently authorized Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies plans for drugs are working.    With the funds provided in this bill, FDA will also make substantial investments in information technology for both foods and medical products that will allow the agency to receive and better analyze adverse events electronically, support electronic submission of applications, and access old data for safety analyses.    The Committee is aware of the proposals for user fees in the President's budget, but does not recommend establishing such fees in annual appropriations acts. The Committee will consider such fees if they are authorized.    The Committee provides funding for the following items:  for the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Commission;  for the National Center for Food Safety and Technology;  for the National Center for Natural Products Research; and  for the New Mexico State University Agricultural Products Food Safety Laboratory. Funding for these activities is included in the President's fiscal year  budget request.    Bill structure.--Although the budget once again requested a statutory ``blank check'' that would remove the specified levels of funding for each center and other activities in the bill, the Committee believes the agency needs more budget controls, not fewer. Therefore, it has maintained the usual bill language structure.    Tobacco legislation.--The Committee notes that H.R. , legislation to give FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products, was cleared by Congress on June , . That bill gives FDA the authority to assess fees on tobacco manufacturers to cover the costs of tobacco activities by that agency. H.R.  is expected to become law soon, although it has not been signed as of the date that the Committee considered this bill. The Committee makes clear its intention that language to authorize the collection and spending of the tobacco fees for fiscal year  will be included in the final appropriations bill for FDA for fiscal year .    Neuroblastoma.--The Committee continues to note the lack of new therapies associated high-risk neuroblastoma. Unlike other pediatric cancers, five-year survival rates for this devastating disease have remained unchanged at approximately  percent for decades. The Committee continues to encourage the FDA to prioritize review of new therapies and treatment protocols for Stage IV neuroblastoma patients.    Sunscreen rule.--In August , FDA published a proposed rule for over the counter sunscreens that would require UVB and UVA testing and labeling. Given the importance of this rule to protecting Americans against skin cancer, the Committee is concerned that FDA has not issued a final rule. The Committee instructs FDA to issue a final rule before December , .    Dietary guidelines.--The Committee notes that during the coming year, the Secretaries of Agriculture and Health and Human Services will receive the report of the  Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, and will then have the responsibility to formulate and issue science-based dietary guidance. In view of the need to communicate clear messages and motivate changes in consumer behavior, the Committee recommends that the Secretaries devise targeted communications strategies that will allow consumers to build their diets around their specific nutritional needs and healthful food choices.    Honey.--The Committee recognizes that honey is produced in the United States, traded internationally and consumed as both a packaged food and as a food ingredient. However, there have been instances where manufacturers have been marketing products illegally as ``honey'' or ``pure honey'' that contained other ingredients. The Committee believes that guidance about the composition and labeling of honey is needed to protect consumers and the domestic honey industry from misbranded honey and honey-derived products that are currently entering the U.S. market. The Committee directs FDA to remind manufacturers of honey about the misbranding and adulteration provisions of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. It is the Committee's understanding that FDA intends to respond to the pending citizen petition proposing a standard of identity for honey, and the Committee expects the agency to do so."

The Committee recognizes the continuing need to provide enhanced oversight and enforcement of commodity futures markets, including the markets for financial instruments, energy, and agriculture futures products. With the continuing volatility in the futures markets, the Committee concurs with the President's request for additional CFTC resources to better secure the markets from improper speculation. The increased funding will allow the agency to continue strengthening its information technology systems and hire additional technical and legal staff.    However, because CFTC will have received a substantial  percent increase in its appropriated funding in just two years, the Committee seeks to ensure that CFTC invests the fiscal year  resources most effectively. Therefore, the Committee directs that, for the increased funding above the fiscal year  appropriation, the agency submit a spending plan to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and Senate for both review and approval before these additional funds can be obligated."

CCC Report.--The Committee directs the Secretary to provide a report on November , , and May , , on planned uses of funding under the authorities of Section  and Section  of the Commodity Credit Corporation Act.    Food Aid Reform.--The bill continues to fund Food for Peace Title II grants. There is agreement on the goals of reducing food insecurity around the globe and furthering the national security interests of the United States. However, there continues to be disagreement on how to achieve these goals in the most efficient and effective manner. The program as currently structured almost doubles the return on the taxpayer's investment by supporting American jobs and farmers while contributing to food security abroad. At this time, the Committee cannot agree to the food aid reform proposal. The proposed changes could cause the program to operate outside of the structure, transparency, and dedicated constituencies provided under the Food for Peace Act.

The Committee reserves the right to call before it any agency that does not submit its report or reports on time.    State Office Collocation.--The Committee continues to direct that any reallocation of resources related to the collocation of state offices scheduled for  and subsequent years is subject to the Committee's reprogramming procedures.    Administrative Provision.--The Committee directs the Secretary to advise the Committees on Appropriations, through the Office of Budget and Program Analysis, of the status of all reports requested of the Department in this bill at the time of submission of the fiscal year  budget and monthly thereafter. The Committee reminds the Secretary that all correspondence related to the directives in this bill must be addressed to the Committee on Appropriations.    Loan and Grant Programs.--The Committee directs the Department, through the Office of Budget and Program Analysis, to provide quarterly reports to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate on the status of obligations and funds availability for the loan and grant programs provided in this bill.    The Committee further directs that if an estimate of loan activity for any program funded in Titles I and III of this bill indicates that a limitation on authority to make commitments for a fiscal year will be reached before the end of that fiscal year, or in any event whenever  per centum of the authority to make commitments has been utilized, the Secretary shall promptly notify the Committees in writing, through the Office of Budget and Program Analysis.    Invasive Species.--The Committee recognizes the threats posed by invasive plant species and the need to protect, restore, and enhance native plants, including those that are endangered or threatened. The Committee encourages the Agricultural Research Service, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture to support the research, education, and conservation of native plants.    BioPreferred Program.--The Committee directs the Department to expeditiously implement changes to the program to include forest products that meet the biobased content requirements as included in the  farm bill.    Farmer-Owned Cooperatives.--The Committee recognizes USDA's long track record working with farmer-owned cooperatives and encourages the Secretary to share the Deparment's knowledge and best practices with other Federal agencies that have cooperative development programs.

Assessments.--The Committee remains concerned that the assessments the Department charges its agencies for government- and department-wide activities continue to escalate. Since these assessments are borne by the agencies, and Congress did not specifically provide increases to the agencies for these costs, most of the funding for the increase has come at the expense of programs. The Committee continues to direct the Office of the Chief Financial Officer to scrutinize the need for each activity, to consider its benefit to the mission of each agency, and to limit spending wherever possible, especially in regards to assessments for the creative media and broadcast center; promotional, voluntary activities; and activities not specifically authorized by Congress."

Mandatory COOL Labeling.--The final rule dealing with mandatory Country of Origin Labeling of beef, pork, and other covered muscle meats sold in U.S. retail establishments is creating great uncertainty for U.S. meat packing, processing, and production companies as well as U.S. retail establishments. While the final rule became effective May , , in order to comply with the World Trade Organization (WTO) findings, USDA's final rule will not likely meet the full demands made by the governments of Canada and Mexico. By USDA's own estimate, the range in estimated costs to industry of the final rule will be . million to . million and affect , firms and , establishments. If the final rule does not produce a resolution, ongoing negotiations between the three countries will only create increased costs and indecision in how the firms meet regulatory requirements. Therefore, the Committee strongly encourages USDA to delay implementation and enforcement of the final rule published on May , , ( Fed. Reg. ) until the WTO has completed all decisions related to cases WT/DS and WT/DS.    National Organic Program.--The Committee recommendation includes a one million increase above the fiscal year  level for the National Organic Program.    Pesticide Recordkeeping Program.--The Committee concurs with the Administration's proposal to eliminate funding for the Pesticide Recordkeeping Program (PRP) and recommends that the States and territories operating under the Federal recordkeeping regulations transition to a program such as those operating in  States and one Territory with their own compliance review programs under federally-recognized state pesticide recordkeeping requirements. As noted in the Administration's fiscal year  proposal, ``this program is not central to the core mission of AMS, which is to facilitate the competitive and efficient marketing of agricultural products.'' The termination of the PRP will result in a savings of . million as proposed in the budget.    Program Levels.--The Committee recommendation includes funding at the President's request level for Marketing News and Surveillance and Standardization Programs.    Seafood in Nutrition Programs.--USDA's Dietary Guidelines for Americans  recommends increased intake of seafood, especially those products with high levels of omega- fatty acids. Due in large part to USDA's own regulations, canned tuna is currently prohibited from purchase by the Department for inclusion in school nutrition programs. The Committee directs USDA to report to the Committees on Appropriations within  days of enactment on potential ways that would allow a revision of the Master Solicitation for Commodity Procurement to allow for the purchase of canned tuna. The report should address the requirement that all tuna be landed by U.S.-flag fishing vessels; the option for less than  percent of the value of the tuna product be United States produced; and the requirement that all tuna products are canned in the United States, its territories, possessions, Puerto Rico, or the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands."

Enhancements to Existing Crop Insurance Programs.--The Committee believes that crop insurance has been an invaluable resource for agricultural producers in times of disaster. At the same time, it has protected taxpayers from costly and unbudgeted disaster assistance bills. The Committee supports the ongoing efforts of the House and Senate Committees on Agriculture to reauthorize provisions of the Farm Bill that maintain and strengthen the existing crop insurance program.    Organic Foods.--The Committee is aware of the legislative mandate in the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of  that an organic price election be offered on all organic crops by  ( U.S.C. (c)()(C)(iii)). The Committee appreciates the recent announcement by the Department regarding a new organic price election for the  insurance year. The Committee is concerned, however, at the pace of progress and requests a report from the Department within  days of enactment detailing its strategic plan and timetable to implement organic price elections for all organic crops produced in compliance with the National Organic Program regulations under the Organic Foods Production Act of  ( U.S.C.  et seq.).    Timely Communication of Changes in Coverage.--Crop insurance represents a key risk management tool for agricultural producers around the country and any changes to their insurance policies can have an immediate impact on critical financial and business decisions. The Committee understands that RMA will implement changes in an effort to reduce the loss ratios in the crop insurance industry, but it is concerned by the timeliness and the manner in which RMA notifies purchasers of changes to crop insurance coverage. The Committee is aware of issues pertaining to the late notification of changes communicated to producers and insurance providers over the past year that may have resulted in negative consequences for both. The Committee expects that RMA will address this issue and ensure effective and efficient administration of the crop insurance program."

The Committee directs FNS to continue making all policy documents related to the WIC program (including, but not limited to, instructions, memoranda, guidance, and questions and answers) available to the public on the Internet within one week of their release to state WIC administrators.    The Committee is concerned about duplicative and overlapping food assistance programs, with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) having cited  different domestic programs that show signs of overlap and inefficient use of resources. The Committee urges FNS to review eligibility requirements and eliminate duplication to ensure families are receiving adequate but not overlapping assistance.    The Committee expects USDA to issue guidelines to the appropriate state agencies on a requirement to include the USDA Inspector General (IG) Fraud Hotline and the IG website address on all SNAP and WIC Electronic Benefit Transfer cards and WIC coupons/vouchers or on any other information that accompanies the WIC instruments for the purpose of reporting potential fraud, waste, and abuse by vendors and/or participants. The Committee directs USDA to issue these guidelines no later than July , .    As part of USDA's effort to reduce fraud, ensure the integrity of its nutrition programs, and safeguard the identities of participants in nutrition assistance programs, the Committee directs the Secretary to provide a report detailing the prevalence of identity theft incidents perpetrated against USDA nutrition program beneficiaries; steps USDA is taking to protect program beneficiaries' personally identifiable information against unauthorized disclosure; and what, if any, actions are being taken to educate participants on the threat of identity theft."
1049,113-116 H.txt,    For the Child Nutrition Programs,"    For the Child Nutrition Programs, the Committee provides . The fiscal year  conference report provided . million for school meals equipment grants, and the fiscal year  budget requests  million for this program. The Committee is aware of the importance of these funds, especially in rural areas, and will continue to monitor the need for this program.    School Meals.--The Committee is concerned about the challenges and costs that local schools face in implementing the school meals final rule. While schools are still working to implement these nutrition standards for lunch, they also must begin implementing these standards for breakfast in the - school year. In addition, USDA recently proposed more regulations on schools. Before USDA can begin implementing the requirements for the School Breakfast Program and the proposed rule on nutrition standards for all foods sold in school, USDA is directed to receive notification from each local school participating in the program that it can implement the final rule on nutrition standards in a workable and cost-neutral manner. While the Committee appreciates the flexibility USDA has provided to schools regarding the grain and protein requirements for school year -, schools will still need certainty into the future. USDA is encouraged to extend this flexibility and provide schools with a long-term policy by September , , to assist them with planning and procurement for future school years. As schools seek to implement the new school meal standards, the Committee encourages USDA to consider ways to assist schools with technical assistance and training to provide healthful, cost-effective foods that students will eat.    Improper Payments.--The Committee continues to be concerned about the staggering improper payment rates in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP). For fiscal year , the NSLP had an error rate of . percent, which is . billion in improper payments. The SBP had an error rate of . percent, or an estimated  million. These programs have some of the highest error and improper payment rates of all Federal programs. The Committee provides funding to support USDA's efforts to reduce erroneous payments and expects USDA to utilize any additional funds necessary from the State Administrative Expenses account to assist States and Local Educational Agencies in reducing errors.    Prioritization of Monitoring and Compliance Reviews.--The Committee directs the Secretary to allow States to vary the frequency of monitoring and compliance reviews of each school food authority based on past school performance, with no cycle extending more than five years as granted in the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of .    Child and Adult Care Food Program.--The Committee directs USDA to verify that CACFP sites, which provide at-risk, after-school snacks and suppers, are in full compliance with the eligibility requirements for participating in the program.    Summer Food Service Pilot Program.--Distressed counties in certain parts of the country face high levels of food insecurity. The Committee supports the efforts that authorize the Secretary to conduct demonstrations to test new models of preventing food insecurity and hunger among children during the summer months. The Committee directs the Secretary to provide a report no later than  days after enactment on the estimated implementation costs and benefits of the models that have been tested and provide recommendations for cost effective ways to promote food security in counties as defined in  U.S.C. .    The following table reflects the Committee recommendations for the child nutrition programs:"
1050,113-116 H.txt,    For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,"    For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), the Committee provides an appropriation of .    The President's budget request includes a projection of an average monthly participation rate of . million women, infants, and children in fiscal year . It is worth noting that previous projections for the average monthly WIC participation rates have been inflated. For example, the President's budget request in fiscal year  projected an average monthly participation rate of . million people, when in fact the average participation rate was . million. In fiscal year , the request projected participation rates of . million, and to date, participation has been well below this estimate, averaging . million participants per month. Birth rates are an important factor in estimating WIC participation, and the number of births has steadily declined since , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Food costs also have been lower than expected. The Committee supports USDA's efforts to promote cost containment and expects some measures being implemented by States to result in lower food costs over the long term.    The Committee also notes USDA has full authority to utilize carry over funds from the previous fiscal year and encourages USDA to work with States on a regular and timely basis to determine the availability of recovery funds as early as possible. Furthermore, the Secretary has  million in the WIC contingency reserve fund as a safety net to meet unexpected demand.    The Committee provides for continuation of the breastfeeding peer counselor program, infrastructure, and investments in management information systems within the total amount provided in the bill, pending a determination by the Secretary that funds are available to meet caseload demand.    The Committee will continue to monitor WIC food costs, participation, and carryover funds and take additional action as necessary to ensure that funding provided in fiscal year  is sufficient to serve all eligible applicants.    Income Eligibility Standards.--The Committee remains concerned that USDA's regulations regarding income eligibility determinations and corresponding allowable practices, including the definitions of income and household, use of programs acceptable for adjunctive or automatic eligibility, and income verification procedures, have created wide disparity among the States, Territories, and Tribal Organizations. Concerns such as these were identified in the February  GAO report, ``WIC Program: Improved Oversight of Income Eligibility Determination Needed.'' In partial response to the report, USDA issued income eligibility guidance to all state agencies on April , . The Committee directs USDA to provide a report within  days of enactment detailing the training, technical assistance, and compliance monitoring activities that USDA will undertake in connection with the release of these guidelines.    Cost Management within WIC State Agencies.--The Committee supports USDA's efforts to rein in the cost of WIC food items while ensuring the nutritional value and food choices for participants. As state agencies consider options for cost containment, the Committee directs FNS to closely monitor this process to ensure there are no unintended consequences for participants, vendors, or product manufacturers. The Committee is aware that USDA is conducting management evaluations of all state agencies since more States have had problems with vendor management and food cost containment. As demonstrated in USDA's oversight of States with violations, USDA has the ability to require state agencies to reduce the maximum dollar amount the state agency reimburses for WIC food items. The Committee directs the Department to provide quarterly updates to the Committee on the management evaluation process, including concerns that have arisen and steps USDA has taken to correct any violations. In addition, the Committee is aware that USDA issued moratoriums that prohibit the authorization of new WIC vendors in some States. While the Department should be applauded for efforts to control costs and address fraud, waste and abuse, both WIC participants and the vendors who serve participants may be negatively impacted by an indefinite moratorium. The Committee directs USDA to submit a report within  days of enactment on the actions States need to take to address Agency concerns, along with a timeline, for lifting these moratoriums.    Vendors Offering Incentive Items to WIC Participants.--The practice of some vendors offering incentive items for purchases of WIC-authorized food items may increase the cost of WIC foods. Incentives may draw WIC participants who would otherwise shop at less expensive WIC-authorized stores. In addition, the price of WIC food items may be increased to cover the cost of incentives. The Committee encourages the Secretary to use existing authority to limit incentives on WIC transactions to help ensure that incentives do not increase WIC food costs and encourages the Secretary to provide recommendations for legislative changes that could help ensure that incentives do not increase WIC food costs.    Childhood Screening.--The Committee recognizes the important connection between childhood lead poisoning and nutrition status. The Committee encourages WIC to partner with stakeholders in an effort to establish point-of-care blood lead screening activities for children who utilize WIC services in underserved communities where childhood lead poisoning rates are high.    Eligible Foods.--The Committee encourages the Secretary to amend  CFR . in order for state agencies to include all varieties of fresh, whole or cut vegetables, except for vegetables with added sugars, fats, oils; provided that inclusion of such vegetables contribute towards meeting the special nutritional needs of program participants and increases the availability of low-cost, high-nutrient alternatives for participants throughout the year."
1051,113-116 H.txt,    For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),"    For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Committee provides . The total amount includes  for a contingency reserve to be used only in the amount necessary.    Fraud, Waste, and Abuse.--The Committee is aware of recent USDA efforts to strengthen the integrity of SNAP by establishing Federal-State data-sharing agreements to reduce fraud. However, the Committee recognizes more can be done to target fraud and has previously directed and expects USDA to permanently debar retailers and participants from the program if found guilty of fraud and abuse. To further assist in this effort, the Committee directs USDA to consider all options, including requiring that retailers participating in SNAP maintain a unique business identification, in order to identify any relationship between a disqualified SNAP retailer and all eligible SNAP participants to effectively screen applicants for criminal activity, fraud, Federal debarment, and questionable business practices.    Employment and Training.--The Committee directs the Secretary to provide a report within  days of enactment on how the SNAP Employment and Training (E&T) program is currently being used to help SNAP participants gain skills and training to find productive employment that will allow them to transition from SNAP to self-sufficiency, including measurable results of the program. The Committee also encourages the Secretary to provide a five-year plan for how the E&T program, as well as any other resources and programs, will be used to help participants find employment.    Recruitment Activities.--The Committee is concerned about the use of valuable tax dollars to promote enrollment of SNAP through radio, television, and other means of advertisements. The Committee is also concerned by outreach activities with foreign governments to encourage use of SNAP. The Committee strongly encourages USDA to cease these types of government-sponsored recruitment activities.    Prepared Foods/Beverages Purchased with SNAP Benefits.--The Committee is concerned that SNAP vendors are allowed to sell prepared food or drink with SNAP benefits beyond those allowances for the homeless, elderly, or disabled. The Committee directs USDA to tighten restrictions on SNAP eligibility for hot prepared foods and extend restrictions to other foods intended for immediate on-premise consumption such as hot prepared beverages and fountain drinks.    Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.--The Committee is aware of the interest in transitioning the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands into SNAP. The Committee directs the Secretary to provide a report on the feasibility of establishing SNAP in the Northern Mariana Islands, including the capabilities of the Commonwealth to fulfill the responsibilities of a state agency by ensuring participation of only eligible households, maintaining program integrity, paying a share of administrative costs with non-federal funds, and other such requirements as deemed necessary by the Secretary to operate SNAP.    The Emergency Food Assistance Program.--The Committee urges USDA to assess the availability of and consider policies and procedures that would make it easier for food banks and pantries to serve populations that may have dietary restrictions due to religious dietary laws.

TEFAP Handling and Distribution Costs.--In addition to the grant funds to support commodity handling and distribution costs, the bill permits States to use up to  percent of the funds provided for purchasing TEFAP commodities to help with the costs of storing, transporting, and distributing commodities. The Committee expects state agencies to consult with their emergency feeding organizations on the need for the conversion of such funds."

The Committee does not provide funding for the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion to develop federal dietary guidance for infants and children from birth to  months of age or to promote the Dietary Guidelines for Americans or MyPlate. The nutrition education services provided through WIC, along with other Federal nutrition education programs, are available to assist with the dietary and nutritional needs of infants and children. The Committee also notes that USDA does significant advertising of the Dietary Guidelines, MyPlate, and other resources to promote healthier lifestyles. These efforts are combined with the ``Let's Move!'' campaign and use of this information by the public and private sectors."
1054,113-116 H.txt,    For the Foreign Agricultural Service,"    For the Foreign Agricultural Service, the Committee provides an appropriation of  and transfers of .    The Committee directs the Secretary, through the Office of Budget and Program Analysis, in consultation with the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, to submit quarterly reports to the Committee on the status of the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust, as well as to immediately notify the Committee when the Trust has been drawn down.    Food for Progress.--The Committee supports the work of the Food for Progress program, which increases rural incomes and enhances food security by improving agricultural productivity, supporting agribusiness development, and expanding the availability of financial services. The Committee encourages USDA to consider the work of non-governmental organizations that are involved in small-scale agricultural biomass projects when issuing awards in the program. These types of projects may offer numerous benefits, from the production of biomass crops to the processing and marketing of crop and animal products.    Performance Goals and Outcome Based Measures.--In April , USDA's Office of Inspector General released a report on FAS performance and said that FAS' performance measures were not outcome-based and do not show how the United States is performing in certain markets compared to its competitors. The Agency's overall agricultural trade strategy, Country Strategy Statements, and USDA's Global Market Strategy need to incorporate measurable goals and outcome-based measures so that USDA can gauge the effectiveness of the investment of appropriated resources. The Committee directs FAS to report no later than December , , to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate on how the Agency is developing outcome-based measures that demonstrate results, and, if applicable, how FAS is changing the allocation of resources to promote increased foreign consumption of U.S. agricultural goods.

Regulations.--The Committee is concerned about duplicative and overreaching regulations that are resource intensive. The Committee includes bill language directing the Commission to submit cost-benefit studies of these regulations to the Committees of jurisdiction.    Swap Dealer De Minimis.--The Committee directs the Commission to submit a report within  days of enactment to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate that: () quantifies the number of swap dealers currently registered with the Commission; () lists the aggregate gross notional amount of swap activity as of the date of enactment per CFTC regulation .(ggg)() for each registered swap dealer without individually identifiable information; () estimates the number of additional swap dealers that will register with the Commission if the de minimis threshold is reduced to  billion; () lists each registered swap dealer, without individually identifiable information, that is deemed a Systemically Important Financial Institution by the Financial Stability Oversight Commission and/or the Financial Stability Board; and () lists the total revenue and assets of each registered swap dealer and corresponds with the data provided in criteria # and # without individually identifiable information.    Administrative Law Judges.--The Committee is concerned about the elimination of the Administrative Law Judges (ALJ) program and a possible reprogramming of those funds while an investigation regarding CFTC's reduction-in-force is ongoing. Further questions have been raised by the Federal ALJ Conference regarding authority under the Administrative Procedures Act and best practices of CFTC's intention to use non-ALJ hearing officers. Minimum requirements for such hearing officers do not include a law degree, but the officers would still be able to make administrative case law disbarring and disqualifying market participants. The additional fact that CFTC has sole authority to hire and fire these non-ALJ hearing officers removes their ability to make independent decisions free from political influence.    Five-year Strategic Information Technology Plan.--The Committee directs CFTC to develop a five-year, strategic technology investment plan. This plan may be produced individually or incorporated as an appendix to the Commission's five-year strategic plan. The plan should include achievable objectives with measurable results supported by projected resource requirements. The focus should be on market surveillance, risk management, and customer protection by transitioning from personnel to technology in today's electronic marketplace.    Pay Cost.--The Committee does not include requested funding for a civilian pay increase across the Commission. Should the President provide a civilian pay increase for , it is assumed that the cost of such a pay increase will be absorbed within existing appropriations for fiscal year ."

Explanatory Notes.--The Committee appreciates receiving the detailed information provided in the Explanatory Notes prepared by the Department and relies heavily on this information when considering budget proposals. These materials have traditionally been prepared for the sole use of the Appropriations Committee in a format consistent with the organization and operation of the programs and the structure of the Appropriations Act. At the direction of the Office of Management and Budget, the Department has changed the format and content of these materials to focus on broader goals and objectives rather than the major program structure followed in the Act and in the actual conduct of the programs. For fiscal year  and future years, the Department is directed to present Explanatory Notes in a format consistent with the presentation used for the fiscal year  Budget. Any deviations from that format are to be approved in advance by the Committee.    Web-Based Supply Chain Management System.--The Committee does not provide  as requested, for the Web-Based Supply Chain Management System (WBSCM). In fiscal year , the Committee directed the USDA to use section  administrative funds to initiate the procurement of WBSCM. The Committee again urges the USDA to use section  administrative funds for WBSCM. USDA's budget justifications acknowledge that the current commodity purchase system has become obsolete and must be replaced. Unfortunately, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has rejected USDA's request to apportion section  funds for the system in fiscal year .    When the Administration came to the Committee last year to pursue the use of section  funds to respond to hurricanes that occurred in Florida, the Committee supported the Administration. It is disconcerting then that the Committee directed a legitimate use of section  funds for WBSCM, and that OMB has refused to apportion the funds. USDA is spending more than  annually to maintain a commodity procurement system that--according to USDA--is ``inflexible, resource intensive, and costly to maintain.'' The implementation of WBSCM could save the USDA several million dollars annually in operational and maintenance costs, increase productivity, reduce purchase and shipping costs, and help reduce the deficit.    Since fiscal year , the Committee has provided the authority for USDA to transfer unobligated balances to the Working Capital Fund to fund various administrative, financial, and corporate systems. Through the use of these funds, significant results have been achieved, including: financial data warehouse; enterprise architecture initiative; civil rights enterprise; integrated acquisition; corporate asset management; and e-travel. Unless the OMB apportions funds in fiscal year  and in subsequent years out of section  for WBSCM, the Committee will be forced to limit the availability of unobligated balances to be used only for the implementation of WBSCM.    Counter-Terrorism Measures.--The Committee supports the efforts of USDA in implementing a national policy for defending the agriculture and food system against terrorist attacks.    State Office Collocation.--The Committee continues to direct that any reallocation of resources related to the collocation of state offices scheduled for  and subsequent years is subject to the Committee's reprogramming procedures. The Committee notes that no such reprogramming requests have been received to date.    Ralstonia.--The Committee notes that the Secretary of Agriculture initiated emergency actions during FY  to ensure the eradication of the disease Ralstonia solanacearum, Race , Biovar , which is of great concern to U.S. agriculture, including ornamentals growers, the potato industry, and others. The Committee strongly urges the Secretary of Agriculture to continue to use existing authority including that provided under CCC, to fund this initiative, and to establish a compensation program for persons suffering from losses as a result of the eradication and control efforts related to this disease. The Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Appropriations a report regarding the feasibility of establishing additional research and forward control programs in countries and/or regions that had been the point of origin for infected product.    Administrative Provision.--The Committee directs the Secretary to advise the Committees on Appropriations in writing of the status of all reports requested of the Department in this bill, at the time of submission of the FY  budget and quarterly thereafter.    Cattle Exports.--The committee is concerned that USDA has not made reopening key export markets for U.S. breeding cattle a priority. The committee instructs USDA, specifically APHIS and FAS, to allocate the resources necessary to reopen export markets for U.S. breeding cattle and to effectively coordinate with other agencies to regain these markets. Increasing export opportunities for U.S. producers should be USDA's top priority.    Rice Reporting.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall prepare a report evaluating the benefits and issues associated with making price reporting mandatory for rice crops. Currently, only  percent of the rice market reports rice prices to the Department of Agriculture, yet the Department uses this limited information to determine counter-cyclical payments for rice producers under the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of . The Committee would like to know whether a benefit would result from making reporting mandatory, and what issues might arise as a result of mandatory price reporting, specifically regarding the Freedom of Information Act ( U.S.C. )."

While the Committee has provided additional funding for this account, the budget justification does not support an increase of  or  percent for the Homeland Security Staff. According to the Explanatory Notes, the only requested increase is for one additional Senior Executive Service (SES) staff year. The Committee has concerns about the need for an additional SES position for a staff of six that already has an SES position filled. The Committee recommendation does not include funds for a second Senior Executive Service position for the Homeland Security Staff."

As a result of OCIO's progress towards completion of two of its highest priorities within fiscal years  and , the establishment of the Information Technology Services organization and key eGovernment initiatives, the Committee believes that the fiscal year  funding level is sufficient to maintain advancement in these two areas as well as other priorities within the Office's purview."
1070,109-102 H.txt,    For the Common Computing Environment,"    For the Common Computing Environment, the Committee provides an appropriation of  the same as the amount available in fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    Since fiscal year , Congress has appropriated over  for the modernization and integration of information systems in USDA's county field offices. The Committee has fully supported this effort, but will expect to see reduced or level funding levels for this account in future budget submissions as a result of anticipated efficiencies and economies of scale.    The following table reflects the Committee's recommendation:"
1071,109-102 H.txt,    For the Office of the Chief Financial Officer,"    For the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and the same amount as the budget request.    The Committee has included bill language that directs the Chief Financial Officer to actively market and expand the cross-servicing activities of the National Finance Center.    The Committee is aware that the National Finance Center's (NFC) proposal for e-payroll consolidation was rated the highest in the competition held by the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management. The Committee believes that the NFC's demonstrated ability to provide a high level of service while operating on a fee-for-service basis provides a significant opportunity to utilize a public/private partnership to provide private investment and share risk in the modernization of systems and infrastructure creation for e-payroll. The Committee encourages the USDA to utilize the NFC to create a public/private partnership, such as the one that the State of Louisiana, private industry, and a consortium of academic institutions has developed, to help leverage scarce Federal resources to continue the modernization and development of Federal government wide e-payroll functions.    The Committee directs the Department to submit a report concurrent with the Department's annual budget submission for the following fiscal year, updating the Committee on its contracting out policies, including agency budgets for contracting out, for fiscal year . The Committee is continuing bill language requiring the submission of the report on contracting out policies and agency budgets, prior to use of any funds appropriated to the Office of the Chief Financial Officer for FAIR Act or Circular A- activities."

Proposed project terminations.--Research budgets submitted by the Department reflect a continuing disregard for Congressional program priorities. The Committee has made it clear on a number of occasions that the role of Congress in identifying essential agricultural needs of this Nation will be maintained. Agricultural research projects of regional and national priority will be funded. There has been no adequate justification presented to the Committee to support proposed project terminations. The Committee urges the Under Secretary to end the recycling of proposed terminations which have already been rejected by the Congress. Should similar proposals be submitted again in the budget for fiscal year , the Committee will expect the Under Secretary to explain and defend each proposed termination in detail during the fiscal year  hearings."

The Committee provides an increase of  for this research at Ames, Iowa, ; Pullman, Washington, ; and Albany, California, .    Broomweed biological controls.--The Committee recognizes that increased infestations of exotic brooms and gorse weeds are causing serious economic and environmental losses to agriculture and rangelands in the Western United States. The Committee directs that this research be continued at the fiscal year  funding level.    Cereal crops research.--The Committee recognizes the research accomplishments of the Cereal Crops Research Laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin on the quality and improved production and marketing practices for small grains, particularly barley and oats. An increase of  is provided in fiscal year  for expanded research on these important commodities.    Citrus plant pathogens.--Exotic and emerging plant diseases may be attributable to genetic shifts in the pathogen population and other processes. The Committee provides an increase of  over fiscal year  to the U.S. Horticultural Research Laboratory at Ft. Pierce, Florida for expanded research on threatening plant pathogens of citrus. This research involves the development of molecular diagnostics and characterization and pathogenosity studies to determine spread and dispersal patterns. The research will focus on citrus canker and citrus greening.    Coffee and cocoa research.--World supply of coffee and cocoa continues to be threatened by severe crop diseases. Disease resistance and alternative research program for coffee and cocoa has important economic benefits and implications for U.S. foreign policy in the coffee and cocoa producing nations of South Central America and West Africa. The Committee provides an increase of  over fiscal year  to the ARS research laboratories at Beltsville, Maryland for expanded research on disease resistance and alternative crop research development for coffee and cocoa.    Conservation tillage.--Better management and conservation of natural resources is essential for sustainable crop production in the Columbia River Plateau and regional areas. The ARS Soil Conservation Laboratory at Pendleton, Oregon conducts non-irrigated dryland research important to this region. The Committee maintains the fiscal year  funding level for this necessary research.    Continuing programs.--The Committee recognizes the importance of ongoing research projects in addressing problems faced by the Nation's food and fiber producers.

The Committee reiterates its position that administrative expenses to support section  purposes are expressly allowed, and that purchase and maintenance of a computer system supporting commodity purchases is an authorized administrative expense. All previous computer systems to support commodity purchase, including the existing Processed Commodity Inventory Management System (PCIMS), have been funded through section . Given the business case for WBSCM, the obsolescence of PCIMS, and the projected savings the new system will bring, the Administration's refusal to fund WBSCM is unsupportable."

In fiscal year , there are estimated to be , fewer participants a month and the average food cost per person per month has decreased by twenty-one cents. The Office of Management and Budget has notified the Committee that the budget request is higher than estimated program needs. Therefore, the recommended funding level, although below the budget request, is currently estimated to be sufficient to meet program needs.

Within the amount provided for Other Activities in the Act,  is for the Office of the Commissioner,  is for the Office of Management,  is for the Office of External Relations,  is for the Office of Policy and Planning, and  is for central services for the Offices in this account.

Pediatric Use of HIV Vaccines.--The Committee recognizes the importance of ensuring that promising HIV/AIDS vaccines are tested in infants and youth as early as is medically and ethically appropriate.

Abuse of Prescription Drugs.--The Committee is interested in the potential benefit from FDA's development of procedures for the processing and review of applications for approval for abuse-resistant formulations of schedule II painkillers and other prescription drugs currently on the market.    The Committee notes that FDA priority review can be granted in cases in which the drug product ``would be a significant improvement compared to marketed products . . . in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a disease'' including ``elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction''. The Committee requests FDA to report on whether a drug less prone to abuse would be considered under that provision, and if so, how many drugs were considered under the provision due to less potential for abuse, and granted priority status.    Additionally, FDA should take all appropriate steps to ensure that health care providers and patients are given all relevant information concerning the abuse-resistant qualities of safer drugs.

In response to the Questions for Record submitted to the Committee in April , FDA reports that spending for the UFMS was  in fiscal year  and is expected to be  in fiscal year , a  percent increase. The Committee has not received the required notification of this increase.

Fees.--The Committee directs that none of the funds made available to FDA in this bill be for any assessments, fees, or charges by DHHS or any other Department or Office unless such assessments, fees, or charges are identified in the FDA budget justification and expressly provided by Congress, or approved by Congress in the official reprogramming process as required in the General Provisions of this bill.    Shellfish safety.--The Committee expects that FDA will continue its work with the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Commission (ISSC) to promote educational and research activities related to shellfish safety in general, and Vibrio vulnificus in particular.

Food safety.--The Committee recognizes the contributions which the National Center for Food Safety and Technology (NCFST) is making toward ensuring the security of the nation's food supply.

WERC.--The Committee expects the FDA to continue its support for the Waste Management Education and Research Consortium (WERC) and its work in food safety technology verification and education at the fiscal year  level.    Antibiotics in shrimp imports.--The Committee continues to have serious concerns regarding seafood safety issues posed by banned antibiotic contamination in farm-raised shrimp imports. It is the Committee's understanding that FDA is now using testing methods that detect chloramphenicol at . parts per billion, rather than  part per billion. The Committee recommends that the FDA, in cooperation with any state testing programs, continue testing of farm-raised shrimp imports for chloramphenicol and other related harmful antibiotics used in the aquaculture industry and ensure that any adulterated shrimp that tests positive for chloramphenicol or other banned antibiotics will be destroyed or exported from the United States. The Committee requests a report by March , , on the number of shrimp samples tested for antibiotics, and the number of positive tests for chloramphenicol in fiscal years ,  and to date in .    Food Labels.--The Committee is interested in ensuring that the public can be certain that the Nutrition Facts panel on food products reflects accurate, lawful and factual nutritional information, particularly as it relates to the New Dietary Guidelines for Americans . Given the important nature of the information provided on the food label, the Committee is concerned that consumers may be faced with illegal low calorie claims, healthy claims and heart health claims. Additionally, there may be product names that violate the standards of identity for particular products. Consumers need to know that they can trust the accuracy of food labels. The Committee, therefore, directs the Agency to systematically examine Nutrition Facts labels, and report to the Committee by February , , with a summary of the types of labeling violations discovered, and the actions taken to address such violations.    Regulation development.--The Committee understands that FDA and FSIS are working on rules related to sausage casings and the small intestine of cattle. The Committee is concerned about the availability of this material, which has not been categorized as a specified risk material. The Committee directs the agency to proceed on rulemaking in a timely manner, and to report to the Committee within  days of enactment on the regulatory status of sausage casings/small intestines and on related guidance for the Field force.    Hearing on budget request.--The Committee has taken the step of withholding five percent of the funds provided to the central offices at FDA until there is a public hearing with the head of the agency on the fiscal year  budget request. The Committee appreciates the willingness of the agency's head to present the budget request in March , and regrets that the administration insisted on postponing his scheduled appearance. The Committee wants to make it clear to the administration that it will insist on a hearing with the agency's head before providing it the funds requested in the budget.    Direct to consumer advertising.--The Committee provides an increase of  for the review of direct-to-consumer drug ads. Because staff levels for these activities, under the Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising and Communication in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research in FDA, have remained flat for some time, despite the growth of direct to consumer ads, the Committee believes this increase is needed."

The Committee urges the Secretary to draft and implement a plan to collect disaggregated data on the numbers of AAPI farmers applying to and participating in the Outreach and Assistance for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers and Veteran Farmers and Ranchers program, as well as the percentage of AAPI farmers benefiting from loan forgiveness as part of the American Rescue Plan, and to submit a report to the Committee within  days of the enactment of this Act.    California Drought Assistance.--In California, many regions of the state have been deemed to be in severe, extreme, or exceptional drought condition. On March , , the Secretary designated  counties in California as primary natural disaster areas due to a recent drought. The Committee endorses the objective process used by USDA in the Secretarial drought designation and encourages the Secretary to use emergency and non-emergency authorities already in law to the maximum extent possible to assist these agricultural producers during the ongoing drought. The Secretary is also encouraged to use his authorities to assist agricultural producers experiencing similar conditions elsewhere in the country.    Climate Change Funding.--The Committee provides a total of  for various offices and agencies to support USDA's efforts in addressing the climate change crisis, specifically on how it affects American farmers and rural communities. Funding is provided for new investments across USDA to focus on climate change research and assessment; measurement and monitoring; greenhouse gas emissions mitigation; carbon sequestration; and clean energy technologies. Given that these are new initiatives, the Committee awaits a carefully developed and articulated plan with more specificities than available in the budget and looks forward to working with USDA on this issue.    Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Report.--The Committee directs the Secretary to provide a report on November , , and May , , on planned uses of funding under the authorities of Section  and Section  of the CCC Charter Act.    CCC Obligations and Commitments.--The Secretary is directed to notify the Committees in writing  days prior to any announcement on the use of funds from the CCC or to the obligation or commitment of any emergency funds from the CCC.    Communication from USDA.--A collaborative working relationship between the Committee and USDA is necessary to ensure efficient and effective implementation of Congress' funding decisions. USDA is directed to ensure that the Committee is notified of major changes to existing policies and any significant developments in its operations, before providing non-governmental stakeholders such information, before making the changes public and before implementing them.    COVID- and Farmworkers.--The living and working conditions of farmworkers make them extremely vulnerable to COVID- exposure and illness. The Committee directs the Secretary to ensure that funding provided for COVID- addresses the extreme needs in farmworker communities.    Customer Service.--The Committee continues to support efforts to improve customer service in accordance with Executive Order . The Committee directs the Secretary to develop standards to improve customer service and incorporate the standards into the performance plans required under  U.S.C.  and to update the Committee of its efforts in this regard.    Emissions Reduction Plan.--The Committee directed USDA to submit a report not later than  days after the enactment of the fiscal year  bill outlining its plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Committee looks forward to receiving the report.    ERS/NIFA Move.--It has been almost exactly two years since the previous Secretary announced his decision to relocate the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) outside the greater Washington, D.C. area. Despite objections from the Committee, members of the House and Senate, numerous current and former staff of both agencies, and stakeholders who depend on the information and support provided by each agency, the Department relocated both agencies, starting in the summer of . One of the stated reasons for the move was to improve the Department's ability to attract and retain highly qualified staff. At the time of the relocation announcement, both ERS and NIFA each had close to  employees. Today, the total number of employees for each agency is still below  percent of total capacity. ERS and NIFA remain shells of their former selves and the loss of institutional knowledge each agency has suffered will take years to overcome. The Committee urges the Secretary in the strongest possible terms to take whatever actions are necessary to restore these agencies to their full employment levels.    Explanatory Notes.--The Committee appreciates the Department's work to restore the Explanatory Notes to the same format as they had been presented prior to fiscal year  and directs that this format be maintained for fiscal year  and beyond.    Grain Terminals.--The Committee notes the ongoing contract negotiations between West Coast grain terminal operators and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and recognizes the importance of reaching an agreement that works for both parties. A failure to reach an agreement could result in an interruption in grain terminal service that would negatively impact the nation's grain exports. The Committee urges all parties to continue negotiating in good faith to ensure an equitable outcome for both grain terminal operators and their workers is expeditiously reached.    Hemp.--The Committee is concerned that the level of allowable THC content in hemp may be arbitrary and pose a burden on hemp producers that is not supported by science. The Committee directs USDA to work with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to study and report to Congress on whether there is scientific basis for the current limit of .% THC in hemp and suggest alternative levels if necessary.    The  Farm Bill included a provision that restricted participation in legalized hemp production of any individual convicted of a drug-related felony for  years after their date of conviction, unless they are part of a hemp pilot program authorized by the  farm bill. This drug felony ban will disproportionately impact communities of color and create another barrier to entry in the hemp industry to populations targeted by past drug policies. The Committee directs USDA to identify barriers to entry for communities of color and provide recommendations on how to ensure communities of color have equal access and opportunity to participate in the hemp industry.    Hemp Extract Regulation.--The Committee is concerned about the inconsistencies in the regulation of the production of hemp by USDA and DEA. Congress vested primary regulatory authority in USDA and expects other regulatory actions to align with it. Congress intentionally expanded the definition of hemp to include derivatives, extracts and cannabinoids in an effort to avoid the criminalization of hemp processing. Committee understands that in-process hemp extract may temporarily exceed the delta- THC concentration of .% before being packaged and sold as a finished product for consumption. Therefore the Committee directs USDA to coordinate directly with the DEA to present the industry with guidance and information on in-process extracted material.    Linking Food and Health.--The Committee understands that many chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, asthma, arthritis and inflammatory diseases, and maternal health and child development can be managed cost effectively by improved nutrition. The Committee understands that the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) five-year plan includes work on how culturally appropriate, food-based solutions can improve health outcomes and save money. The Committee encourages USDA to keep working closely with the Department of Health and Human Services on these issues.    Loan and Grant Programs.--The Committee directs that if an estimate of loan activity for any program funded in Titles II and III of this bill indicates that a limitation on authority to make commitments for a fiscal year will be reached before the end of that fiscal year, or in any event when  percent of the authority to make commitments has been utilized, the Secretary shall promptly notify the Committees through the Office of Budget and Program Analysis (OBPA). The Committee directs the Department, through OBPA, to provide quarterly reports to the Committees on the status of obligations and funds availability for the loan and grant programs provided in this bill.    Military Service.--The Committee is concerned that % of Americans between the ages of  to  are ineligible for military service because of obesity, mental and other physical health issues, or substance abuse. The Committee recognizes that federal support for childhood nutrition, food security, physical education, mental and physical health, and substance abuse prevention will benefit all Americans, including those Americans who intend to serve in the Armed Forces. The Committee encourages the Secretary to work with the Secretaries of Defense and HHS to help assist in communicating nutritional standards to state local, and tribal government for children attending early childhood programs and K- schools.    National Finance Center.--The National Finance Center (NFC) is the largest designated Federal Government Payroll Shared Service Provider and it provides integrated payroll and personnel services for over , Federal employees. To ensure that thousands of Federal employees' pay and human resources services are not interrupted or adversely impacted by major organizational changes, the Committee maintains the requirements under current law relating to NFC payroll and shared services operations, missions, personnel, and functions. The Committee also directs USDA to provide quarterly reports on full-time equivalent (FTE) levels for each of the current NFC divisions, operations, and functions, as well as each of the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) and Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) divisions, operations, and functions currently co-located with the NFC. The reports also are to include a detailed breakdown of the FTEs for each and any of these same divisions, functions, or operations for the NFC and the co-located OCFO and OCIO functions compared to those during fiscal year  and .    Native Plant Use Preference.--The Committee continues to support the use of locally adapted native plant materials in the undertaking of land management activity on Federal lands under the jurisdiction of USDA, including in maintenance and in restoration in response to degradation caused by human activity or natural events (such as fire, flood, or infestation). The Committee continues to direct that it be the policy of USDA that preference shall be given, to the extent practicable, to the use of locally adapted native plant materials in these cases.    New Initiatives.--The Committee requests USDA, no later than  days after enactment, to submit an execution plan for each new initiative funded in this Act. This strategy should include, but is not limited to, the steps necessary to make funding available, the timeline thereof, targeted beneficiaries, and expected results. The Committee requests quarterly reports on these initiatives until the initiative has been fully implemented.    Notification Requirements.--The Committee reminds the Department that the Committee uses the definitions for transfer, reprogramming, and program, project, and activity as defined by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). As noted in the  Joint Explanatory Statement, a program, project, or activity (PPA) is an element within a budget account. PPAs are identified by reference to include the most specific level of budget items identified in the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Act, , accompanying Committee reports, explanatory statements, and budget justifications. The Committee notes that the most specific level of budget items in the USDA budget justifications is not limited to tables titled ``Project Statement''.    Pacific Ants.--The Committee requests APHIS, ARS, and the Forest Service to provide a report, within  days of enactment of this Act, on the Biosecurity Plan for Invasive Ants in the Pacific. The report should describe components of the plan related to () research; () the development of technologies and methodologies for prevention, eradication, and control of invasive ants; and () the collaborative implementation of projects to prevent, monitor, and control invasive ants in affected Pacific islands.    Pay Costs.--The Committee provides the requested pay cost and FERS costs for all offices and agencies of USDA funded in this bill.    Protecting Animals with Shelter Grants Program.--The Committee provides  for the program. It directs the Secretary of Agriculture to continue coordinating with other federal agencies to efficiently implement the grant program for providing emergency and transitional shelter options for domestic violence survivors with companion animals.    Spending Plans.--The bill continues a provision in Title VII that requires USDA to submit spending plans to the Committee within  days of enactment. Previous versions of these plans have not included adequate details that would be useful for Committee oversight. The Committee requests that the USDA spending plans include for each program, project, or activity: () a comparison between the congressional budget justification funding levels, the most recent congressional directives or approved funding levels, and the funding levels proposed by the department or agency; and () a clear, concise, and informative description/justification. The Committee reminds USDA of notification requirements, also included in Title VII, for all applicable changes.    Status of House and Senate Report Language.--The Department is directed to include in its fiscal year  Congressional Justification, as a single exhibit, a table listing all deliverables, with a column for due dates if applicable. OBPA is directed to provide updates on the status of House and Senate reports upon request from the Committees.    USDA-owned Vehicles.--The Committee continues to await the report requested in the fiscal year  report on how the Department plans to better manage its vehicle fleet."

The Committee encourages the Department to work with EPA to incorporate best practices to use composting to avoid food waste and to share education and other resources with those entities involved in food production and use.    Conservation Programs timeline.--The Committee recognizes the importance of NRCS's conservation programs and their positive impact on water and soil quality. The Committee also recognizes these programs must consist of realistic timelines and outcomes as identified by the farmers using them. The Committee encourages NRCS to review all conservation programs to ensure their timelines related to conservation planning and program delivery meet legislatively mandated timelines to support farmers to develop their practices and fulfill the mission of the programs and report back on its findings and efforts to improve program funding timelines.    Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) Bundles.--The Committee recognizes the important role the agriculture sector can play in the effort to mitigate the impacts of global climate change and understands CSP is well-positioned to enhance support for agricultural practices and systems with the greatest climate change adaptation and mitigation potential. The Committee encourages NRCS to create climate change mitigation bundles within CSP, as recommended in the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis June  report. Climate change mitigation bundles should include practices that reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, such as improved nutrient management, and practices that increase carbon sequestration and improve soil health, such as using cover crops, conservation tillage, diverse and resource-conserving crop rotations, and advanced grazing management. Given the wide geographic variations in climate, rainfall, soil, and topography, the bundles should be region specific and provide flexibility, allowing bundles to be tailored to the needs and conditions of each operation.    Cover Crop Management.--The Committee provides  from within the funds provided and directs NRCS to bolster ongoing applied efforts of the Soil Health initiative linking soil health and cover crop management with an On-Farm Research Network in conjunction with public and private sector partners on private and public grazing and crop lands. Plant cover that supports soil health for soil function, lower production risks, better crop production and that as food source for grazing animals offers an important carbon capture mechanism that can enhance farming outputs and economics. In addition, optimal regenerative agriculture requires integrated crop and animal production on the farm. The Committee is interested in understanding the barriers, economics and challenges facing producers to increase cover crop practices and better define the benefits and economics of cover crop performance across different regions, management scenarios, climatic zones, and soil types. A focus should be on developing a decision-support platform to help producers establish a cover crop expert network to help producers in corn producing states establish and manage cover crops, increase their use, and measure the diverse benefits.    Customer Data Systems.--The Committee recognizes that NRCS recently updated its software systems that track applications and manage projects. Staff have been trained on these data systems, but a survey of these staff identified that the new software is creating more work, delaying applications, and necessitating workarounds. The Committee is interested in understanding what steps are being taken to improve these data systems and to assure that internal processes are not delayed. Within  days of passage of the act, NRCS will provide an update on plans to assess efficacy of software systems, make recommendations for yearly surveys of staff to assess efficiency and make swift corrective action plans to resolve software limitations.    Critical Conservation Areas (CCAs).--The Committee supports CCAs and the collaborative regional approach to address common natural resources goals while maintaining or improving agricultural productivity. The Committee encourages NRCS to provide Conservation Technical Assistance additional funds to CCAs to address conservation planning backlogs.    Driftless Area Landscape Conservation Initiative.--The Committee recognizes the environmental and economic benefits of the Driftless Area Landscape Conservation Initiative, which expired in .

Environment-based Flood Mitigation Measures.--The Committee recognizes that environment-based mitigation measures such as the creation of wetlands, conservation easements, and natural flood plains to slow the flow rate of rivers, creeks, and streams, are innovative tools to mitigate the severity of future floods in the Great Lakes Bay Region. These measures also support a variety of environmental and conservation benefits including erosion control, species habitat, and improved air and water quality. The Committee urges the Department to participate and coordinate as an essential federal stakeholder with EPA, FEMA, NOAA, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as well as state, local, and tribal governments, and business and non-profit stakeholders, on developing and supporting conservation and environment-based flood mitigation measures to reduce the impact of floods on communities, lives, and livelihoods within the Tittabawassee River Watershed in the Great Lakes Bay Region.    Farmer Mentorship Program for Watershed.--The Committee is concerned about soil and water quality near watersheds such as the Great Lakes Basin, Salton Sea, Lake Okeechobee, and the Chesapeake Bay. The Committee recognizes that farmers may be unaware of possible or necessary conservations efforts that currently exist to improve the soil and water quality. The Committee encourages NRCS to leverage its recently created CAMP mentoring effort to enhance outreach efforts with dedicated farmers in watersheds with conservation expertise to work with interested farmers who would like to learn how to implement improved conservation practices for water and soil in their operations.    Farmers' Markets.--The Committee recognizes the importance of Farmers' Markets in urban and rural food deserts. Farmers' Markets are vehicles that allow local farmers to provide healthy foods to low income communities and can serve as a centerpiece for planning and local economies. The Committee encourages the Office of Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production to collaborate with AMS to create funding opportunities through the Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program and the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program to develop or improve farmers' markets and their ability to access local community markets.    Feral Hogs.--The Committee is concerned that the feral hog population is rapidly expanding despite efforts to constrain their spread. To help prevent further damages to agriculture and urban lands, the Committee provides NRCS  for a cost-share program for the construction and repair of perimeter fencing. The Committee encourages NRCS, in conjunction with state soil and water conservation agencies, to develop a strategy to exclude feral hogs from agricultural and urban areas at risk of damage from localized feral hog populations with lessons learned from the existing Feral Hog Eradication Pilot Program.    Grazing Lands Conservation.--The Committee recognizes the importance of collaborative technical assistance to help producers effectively manage grazing lands to protect water quality, improve soil health, sequester carbon in the soil, and increase resilience and producer profitability. The Committee directs NRCS to increase support for partnerships that provide grazing lands conservation technical services such as grazing planning, workshops and demonstrations, peer-to-peer education, workforce training, and producer outreach, including support for partnerships that address unique needs at the local, state, and regional level.    Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs).--The Committee strongly supports and directs funding to NRCS's ongoing work to reduce nutrient loading from agricultural sources that can contribute to the growth of harmful algal blooms. Funding shall be used for targeting of watersheds where harmful algal blooms pose a threat and implementing a variety of conservation systems to address all transport pathways of phosphorus and nitrogen from agricultural land uses. Conservation planning should prioritize fields or riparian areas with the highest risk of elevated phosphorus and/or nitrogen losses. The Committee encourages NRCS to use interagency agreements and cooperative agreements focused on innovative phosphorus or nitrogen removal strategies where agricultural runoff has contributed nutrients to a waterbody. Such work shall be conducted in consultation with the National Institute for Food and Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service.    Lake Erie Basin.--The Committee is aware the Western Lake Erie Basin Initiative (WLEB) is vital to researching and conserving one of our country's precious freshwater sources, Lake Erie. Increased levels of harmful algal blooms continue to plague the Lake due to shallow depths, increased phosphorus levels, and other contributing factors. The Committee encourages NRCS to work with locally engaged academic institutions that have worked on WLEB concerns and to review the work done by these academic institutions along with the Federal and State agencies that have responsibility for tracking lake water quality.    Mississippi River Basin.--The Committee continues to urge the Department to use its existing expertise and experience with the Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watershed Initiative to participate and coordinate as an essential federal stakeholder with EPA's development of the Mississippi River Restoration and Resiliency Strategy, as directed in H. Rpt. -. The Department is also directed to engage with the U.S. Geological Survey as they host the Mississippi River Science Forum and to contribute to the proceedings as a federal agency with relevant scientific expertise.    National Resource Inventory (NRI).--The Committee encourages NRCS to consider the feasibility of expanding the existing NRI system to include soil sampling and analysis on an annual rotating basis.    Outreach and Innovation.--The Committee acknowledges the need for expanded research in support of urban agriculture in food-insecure communities. The Committee believes urban farming and food production closer to the home is a viable solution to these challenges and encourages the Department to create partnerships and, with its extension programs, to assist urban agricultural production. The Committee directs NRCS to maintain grants to support urban agriculture outreach and innovation.    Pollinator Seed Mixes.--The Committee encourages NRCS to provide support to producers through the development of affordable, regionally appropriate pollinator seed mixes that avoid attracting crop pests.    Recovering Value from Animal Waste.--The Committee directs NRCS to provide technical assistances and EQIP resources to support optimal life cycle management of manure as integral to regenerative, resilient agriculture. The Committee directed the Secretary to convene all federal agencies who regulate or impact animal manure. The collaboration among agencies assess the following: ) direct and indirect financial revenue opportunities; ) the potential value of i) on-farm reuse of products such as fertilizer application to cropland; ii) remanufactured products; iii) energy recovery; ) potential tax credits; ) nutrient recovery; ) grants and loan incentives; and ) other sources of revenue. The Committee has provided ERS with  to conduct the report. Within one year of passage of this Act, provided that ERS has completed their report, the Secretary will recommend a strategy to Congress to improve life-cycle management of manure and policies and credits needed to scale solutions across farm country that are acceptable to farmers.    Regenerative Agriculture.--Regenerative agriculture practices stand to help farmers while addressing the multiple challenges our nation faces in climate change, land degradation and risk, biodiversity, water security, and food access. The Committee recognizes the role of programs like the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and Conservation Innovation Grants in providing financial assistance to farms interested in improving soil health. NRCS is encouraged to continue supporting farmers that embrace regenerative agriculture practices, including continued investments in soil health demonstration projects.    Resource Conservation and Development Councils (RC&Ds).--The Committee recognizes RC&Ds have been valuable partners in conservation and encourages NRCS to continue working with local councils, as appropriate, to ensure conservation programs meet local resource needs.    Sage Grouse Initiative.--The Committee supports NRCS's sage grouse conservation efforts. Through the initiative, NRCS provides technical and financial assistance to help landowners conserve sage grouse habitat on their land. The initiative is an integral part of efforts by federal agencies, several western states, and private landowners to help preclude the listing of the sage grouse as an endangered species.    Soil Carbon Survey.--The Committee recognizes the need for a regular soil carbon survey to improve the effectiveness of environmental incentive programs and elucidate the relationships between soil carbon content and agricultural yields, water and fertilizer-use efficiency, climate resilience, and other soil health metrics. To the extent possible using existing resources, the Committee encourages the Soil Surveys Program to measure, monitor, and model soil carbon sequestration on agricultural lands.    Sustainable Farming Methods.--The Committee recognizes the urgent necessity of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to mitigate the impacts of global climate change and the important role the agriculture sector can play in that effort. Small and mid-size farmers are uniquely positioned in mitigating the cumulative effects of climate change. The Committee encourages USDA to review its conservation practice standards and technical resources to identify and develop best practices and related conservation systems for existing small and independent farmers seeking to transition to more sustainable farming methods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from nitrogen fertilizers and to sequester carbon as part of any commodity crop, specialty crop, horticulture, or forage production.

As work begins on the - DGA, the Committee reminds the Department of the importance of a transparent, deliberative process that is rigorous, objective, and designed to avoid non-scientific notions of nutrition policy. The Committee looks forward to reviewing the analysis and findings in the upcoming National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report as required in Section  of P.L. -.    Dietary Guidelines for Americans Implementation.--The Committee directs the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) to develop materials to educate consumers on how to use the new Dietary Guidelines to inform their dietary choices, including through developing and translating materials to other languages, and creating materials that represent a diversity of cultural food preferences. The Committee encourages CNPP to work with HHS to develop materials for comprehensive education campaigns aimed at: ) educating consumers on how to use the new Dietary Guidelines to inform their dietary choices, and ) educating health care professionals to enhance and align their dietary guidance with the new Guidelines. The Committee recognizes this is the first time that the guidelines included age-specific recommendations for children from birth to twenty-four months old and encourages CNPP to engage key stakeholders such as pediatricians, nurses, and dietitians.    Emergency Response.--The Committee directs the Secretary within  days of enactment of this Act to report on improvements needed to ensure that emergency feeding programs geared toward natural disasters are also adequately prepared for pandemic response. The report should include executive actions already able to be taken, as well as recommendations for Congress on needed statute changes to target pandemic response more appropriately.    Local Food.--The Committee recognizes the growing demand for locally and regionally produced food. The Committee encourages all nutrition programs, to the extent feasible, to engage local agriculture producers to enhance small farmers and regional producers. The Committee directs FNS to review its Child Nutrition Programs and other food distribution programs to determine how many of their commodity purchases are locally sourced and how to improve procurement from local and small farmers.    Public Release of Information.--The Committee directs FNS to continue making all policy documents related to the WIC program (including, but not limited to, instructions, memoranda, guidance, and questions and answers) available to the public on the Internet within one week of their release to WIC state administrators.    School Meal Programs.--The Committee recognizes the wide-reaching impacts COVID- has had on schools across the country and appreciates USDA's decision to extend several child nutrition waivers through June  to ensure all schools can reopen safely. COVID- has also had severe consequences for school meal program budgets. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, , provided financial assistance, but many schools still face meal program losses for the - School Year. The Committee supports additional assistance to help alleviate financial stress and to help schools avoid cutting into their education budgets."
1221,117-82 H.txt,    For the Child Nutrition Programs,"    For the Child Nutrition Programs, the Committee provides  which includes  for school meals equipment grants,  for the Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) for Children Demonstration,  for Farm to School grants and  for Team Nutrition.    Farm to School.--The Committee is interested in ensuring that the Farm to School program becomes scalable and replicable across states. Training states in maximizing the program is best managed by states that have excelled in implementing the program. Multiple regions of the country should act as locations for Farm to School Institutes. In order to expand the current outreach efforts,  of the Farm to School program will be directed toward cooperative agreements to support at least four Farm to School Institutes that represent the East, Midwest, West, and South regions of the country for the creation and dissemination of information on farm to school program development and to provide practitioner education, training, ongoing school year coaching, and technical assistance, for programs linking curriculum, local purchasing and community connections.    Food Waste Education.--USDA's nutrition programs reach nearly one in four Americans every day, including approximately  million children through school feeding programs. This reach provides a significant opportunity to increase public awareness of food loss and waste and ways to prevent it. The Committee encourages the USDA to include food waste education and prevention information as a priority for each of these programs, and incorporate food waste prevention and reduction information into all nutrition education materials geared toward teachers, students, and other program recipients.    Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program.--The Committee appreciates the collaboration between USDA and the Department of Defense on its Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, which is available in over  states/territories and serves more than , schools. The Committee encourages DOD and USDA FNS to review current practices to identify opportunities to increase food purchases from small, medium, women and minority farmers within their respective states, and, within  days of enactment, report back on their findings.    Local Food in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP).--The Committee is aware that school meals are a vital source of food and nutrition for elementary and secondary students. The Committee recognizes the NSLP could do more to support local economies and businesses through increased participation with local producers and encourages efforts to increase local food purchases for the NSLP sourced from in-state or geographically local growers and producers.    Meal Patterns.--The Committee supports efforts to provide children with the most nutritious meals possible through the National School Lunch and Breakfast Program. Over the last ten years, we have seen schools make great strides in improving the nutritional quality of meals served. As the Department considers further changes to the current meal pattern standards, the Committee acknowledges the need to be sensitive to financial viability, student participation and stigmatization in the program. We urge the Department to consider the impact of any new standards on schools' ability to serve nutrient dense components, including those that are dairy or meat protein based, as well to provide schools the necessary flexibility to serve regional and culturally-inclusive meals that also meet the wide variety of student dietary preferences.    Persistent poverty counties.--The Committee is aware that the Administration has proposed to expand the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) and make it more financially viable for schools by increasing the proportion of costs covered by the Federal government to make CEP a cost-effective option for more schools. The Committee is particularly concerned about CEP participation in persistent poverty counties. The Committee encourages USDA to explore what strategies might be adopted to address the unique participation challenges faced by persistent poverty counties and rural communities such as the border region colonias communities.    School Breakfast Expansion Grants.--The Committee remains concerned that while participation in the School Breakfast Program is increasing, many children who are eligible for the School Breakfast Program are not participating. Therefore, the Committee provides  for grants for expansion of the School Breakfast Program, of which  is dedicated to the U.S. territories.    Team Nutrition.--The Committee supports the promotion of nutritional health of school children by establishing team nutrition networks to promote physical fitness awareness and obesity prevention programs, and to establish programs such as school gardens. The Committee provides a  increase for training and technical assistance to help schools provide nutritious meals that meet meal standards and continues to direct  to support schools meet the sodium reduction targets.    Training for School Food Service Personnel.--The Committee recognizes the limitations of the professional standards set for school food service personnel under the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act of . The Committee directs the Secretary to encourage training programs carried out under Section (g)()(B) of the Child Nutrition Act of  that are scheduled primarily during regular, paid working hours. Whenever appropriate, such training shall be offered in-person and incorporate hands-on training techniques.    Unpaid School Lunch Fees.--The Committee is concerned with reports that some students with unpaid school lunch fees are treated unfairly and being publicly embarrassed. The Committee continues to direct the Secretary to issue recommended standards schools may adopt to address the issue of shaming school children for unpaid school lunch fees, including standards that protect children from public embarrassment; that strongly encourage all communications about unpaid school lunch fees be directed at the parent or guardian, not the child; and that encourage schools to take additional steps to work with families falling behind in their school lunch fees.    Yogurt.--The Committee is aware that after soliciting Requests for Information on the food crediting system for the school lunch and breakfast programs, FNS decided to maintain the current crediting standard for strained, high-protein yogurt. The Committee encourages the Secretary to continue evaluating how strained, high protein yogurt is credited based on the best available science and provide an update to the Committee.    The agreement provides the following for Child Nutrition Programs:"
1222,117-82 H.txt,    For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,"    For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, the Committee provides an appropriation of . The Committee provides  for the breastfeeding peer counselor program and  for infrastructure, and  for management information systems.    After a decade of decline, the President's budget request includes a projection of an average monthly participation rate of . million women, infants, and children for fiscal year , an increase of about , participants compared to the prior fiscal year. The Committee provides funding that will ensure all eligible participants will be served and to increase the amounts of fruits and vegetables in the WIC Food Package.    The Committee is steadfast in its commitment to fully fund WIC and recognizes funding needs might change as the country continues to respond to and recovery from the COVID- pandemic. The Committee will continue to monitor WIC participation trends, carryover funds, and food costs and take additional action as necessary.    Blood Lead Screening.--The Committee is concerned about reports that have found child blood lead screening has declined during the pandemic, in some states dropping by as much as % compared to the previous year. The Committee encourages WIC to continue making referrals and do screenings for a blood lead test when appropriate.    Breastfeeding Rates.--The Committee recognizes that after a decade of decline, WIC participation is anticipated to increase in FY . As more women participate in the program, the Committee recognizes there is an opportunity to have a substantial impact on childhood obesity by creating a more effective focus on increasing breastfeeding rates and is interested in better understanding the impediments to increased breastfeeding rates in WIC recipients, specifically impediments that may be unique to WIC as compared to the general population. As noted in USDA's WIC Participant and Program Characteristics  Report, . percent of infant WIC participants were breastfed at  months of age compared with . percent of infants in the general U.S. population and compared with the Nation's Healthy People  goal of . percent. The Committee directs FNS to consider additional efforts to further promote breastfeeding to improve breastfeeding rates over the next  years. Within  days, the Committee requests a briefing on FNS's current breastfeeding strategies, impediments unique to the WIC program, and possible solutions for improvement.    Maternal Mortality Data.--The Committee remains concerned about maternal mortality and awaits the report detailed in H. Rpt. -.    Outreach.--The committee is concerned that the  Final Rule ( F.R. ) discouraged people from applying to WIC who otherwise would have been eligible. That rule is no longer in effect and the committee directs FNS to inform the Committee on how it plans to spend the  million provided in the American Rescue Plan, including specific outreach efforts to eligible individuals and households.    WIC Food Package.--The Committee recognizes that up-to-date food packages, comprised of a diversity of foods and reflective of community preferences results in women and children consuming healthy diets. The Committee understands that FNS has already begun work to update the WIC food packages through a formal rulemaking.    WIC Study.--The Committee directs FNS to publish state level estimates of the percentage of pregnant women, infants, and children under age five participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program under the Food and Nutrition Act of  ( U.S.C.  et seq.) but not in this program and the percentage of pregnant women, infants, and children up to age five participating in the Medicaid program ( U.S.C.  et seq.) with income less than the limit in section (d)()(A)(i) of the Child Nutrition Act of  but not in this program."
1223,117-82 H.txt,    For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,"    For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Committee provides . The total amount includes  for a contingency reserve to be used only in the event and in the amount necessary. The Committee also includes a such sums appropriation in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, as requested by the Administration, in case participation exceeds expected levels or there is a disaster that cannot be managed through use of the contingency funds.    Barriers to Accessing SNAP.--The Committee is concerned that eight million more families have fallen into poverty since the start of the pandemic, accelerating the poverty and hunger crisis in this nation. The Committee also understands that longstanding inequities stemming from structural racism have exacerbated the impact COVID- has had on the country and especially communities of color. Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, Black and Latino adults are all two times more likely to report food insecurity than white adults. The Committee directs the Secretary, within one year of enactment, to report on factors contributing to inequitable barriers of access to SNAP, such as the able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWD) requirement, limited in-language resources, limited culturally responsive outreach standards, limited in-person and call center availability, and other factors that produce inequitable access to SNAP.    College Hunger.--The Committee remains concerned that SNAP-eligible students who are food-insecure lack proper information about resources available to them. Under regular SNAP eligibility requirements, students enrolled at least half time in an institution of higher education are typically ineligible for SNAP benefits unless they meet certain specific exemptions. Public Law - included provisions to temporarily expand SNAP eligibility to students. The Committee continues to direct FNS to make information available on its website regarding student SNAP eligibility requirements easier to understand and more accessible. The Committee directs FNS to report back on the number of students who enrolled in SNAP due to this increased flexibility and provide any lessons learned.    Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR).-- The Committee supports FDPIR and the ability of tribal organizations to enter into  self-determination contracts for the procurement of FDPIR foods. The Committee encourages FNS to ensure the SNAP program does not limit tribes from accessing the additional benefits of FDPIR and requests that within  day of enactment of this Act, FNS engage a dialogue with Congress on how to integrate SNAP and FDPIR.    Military Food Insecurity.--The Committee recognizes that COVID- exacerbated food insecurity for millions of people, including members of the military. The Committee is also aware that the Basic Allowance for Housing that members of the military receive is not excluded as income when calculating eligibility for SNAP. The Committee supports a reevaluation and revision of this policy to reduce the number of military members relying on food banks and to ensure all members of the military have access to healthy, nutritious food.    SNAP Online Pilot Program.--The Committee commends the expansion of online SNAP pilot program and encourages the Secretary to ensure that these programs include adequate language assistance and translation services for SNAP participants with limited English proficiency.    TEFAP Administration.--The Committee encourages FNS to work with state and local agencies looking to use their administrative funds to procure delivery services to reach unique, high-density, food insecure populations in urban and rural areas lacking adequate transportation.    TEFAP Local Purchase.--The Committee is aware that TEFAP distributors such as foodbanks, soup kitchens, and food pantries have a natural bond with their local farmers. The Committee encourages FNS to explore innovative ways to procure food directly from small and local farmers.    Territories.--The Committee recognizes the inadequacy and inefficacy of the current Nutrition Assistance Program block grant funding for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and American Samoa, which has had to be repeatedly supplemented in response to natural disasters and the COVID- pandemic. The Committee encourages FNS to engage the appropriate stakeholders and directs FNS to provide the Committee with updates on the separate plans and discussions to includes theses territories in SNAP. The Committee directs FNS to provide cost estimates for including Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in SNAP.    The agreement provides the following for SNAP:"

The Committee recommendation includes  for the Farmers' Market Nutrition Program, an increase of   for administrative funding for The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), an increase of  and maintains the  level of  for the Food Donations Programs for Pacific Island Assistance.    TEFAP and food boxes--The Committee believes that all federal feeding programs must be accessible for those with culturally or religiously sensitive diets, including kosher and halal. The Committee urges the Secretary to seek input from Jewish and Muslim community leaders on this issue. The Committee requests a report within  days from the enactment of this Act on how to overcome the challenges of incorporating kosher and halal food into TEFAP, as well the amount of kosher and halal food purchased in the Farmers to Families Food Box Program, as well as TEFAP during the COVID- public health emergency.    TEFAP Handling and Distribution Costs.--In addition to grant funds supporting commodity handling and distribution costs, the bill permits states to use up to  percent of the funds provided for purchasing TEFAP commodities to help with the costs of storing, transporting, and distributing commodities. The Committee expects state agencies to consult with their emergency feeding organizations on the need for the conversion of such funds."

The Committee provides increases in funding of  for International Cooperative Administrative Support Services,  for Capital Security Cost Sharing,  for locally employed staff, and  for pay and retirement contributions.    Farmer-to-Farmer.--Food insecure countries benefit from a diversity of expertise in developing sustainable agricultural practices as supported under Feed the Future, particularly curricula developed by land-grant colleges and universities that support agricultural extension services. The United States Agency for International Development-administered (USAID) Farmer to Farmer program can play a key role in maximizing these efforts. Within  days of enactment, the Committee directs USDA to consult with USAID in an effort to develop a deeper understanding of the operation of the Farmer to Farmer program. Following consultations with USAID, USDA shall provide the Committees an assessment of the benefits of USDA collaborating with USAID to operate Farmer to Farmer to help assure that the program is effective in meeting the goals of the Global Food Security Act, Feed the Future, and the mission of FAS. This assessment will provide beneficial information in the reauthorization of Feed the Future and as a guidepost for discussions during the next Farm Bill reauthorization.    International Agricultural Education Fellowship.--The Committee maintains the  level for this program. The Committee is interested in exploring how this program can support ongoing efforts at FAS. Prior to issuing any future funding awards, the Committee continues to direct USDA to brief the Committees on how the International Agricultural Education Fellowship program will work in collaboration with programs administered by USDA, USAID, and other relevant U.S. government agencies.    U.S., Central America, and Mexico Cooperation.--The Committee directs FAS to work with its counterparts in Central America and Mexico to improve the efficiency of the agricultural inspection process and agricultural trade facilitation issues. FAS in partnership with USDA technical agencies, U.S. land grant universities, and USDA Cooperators can work effectively with counterparts in government agencies and regional agricultural institutions in Central America and Mexico to promote farmer resilience to climate change effects such as drought and flood, and achieve improvements in food security through capacity-building in climate-smart agricultural technologies and practices, and fostering relevant scientific exchanges. The Committee notes that last year's House report directed the Department to brief the Committees on these efforts. The Committee looks forward to receiving this briefing."

Public/private partnerships.--The Committee recognizes the value of public/private partnerships in financing rural communities and facilities and also recognizes that the Farm Credit Act of , as amended, provides authority for Farm Credit System institutions to make investments in vital rural community facilities. The Committee recognizes that the Farm Credit Administration's current approach to approving these types of Farm Credit System investments on an individual basis does not meet the needs of rural communities. The Farm Credit Administration is encouraged to change its current process to create a clear, programmatic approval process which enables timely, comprehensive and cost effective rural community facilities financing packages by allowing and expediting Farm Credit System institutions' partnerships with community banks, other financial institutions, and USDA."
1236,107-623 H.txt,    For the Office of the Secretary,"    For the Office of the Secretary, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    Building security and terrorism prevention.--The Committee recommends  to remain available until expended, for building security and other terrorism prevention costs, as requested.    Community Involved in Sustaining Agriculture.--The Committee directs the Secretary to work with the Community Involved in Sustaining Agriculture (CISA) to increase and expand buy local initiatives including farmer's markets throughout Massachusetts, to expand technical assistance provided for sustainable farming practices, and to expand their media campaign to educate consumers about the importance of buying locally grown agriculture products.    Organizational streamlining and restructuring activities.--The Committee does not recommend the budget request for  to remain available until September , , for workforce and organizational streamlining and restructuring activities related to Service Center Agencies.    Plant and animal pest and disease emergencies.--The Committee is concerned about the increasing risk to our nation's food supply from plant and animal pests and diseases. Recent examples include citrus canker in Florida, glassy-winged sharpshooter in California, Asian longhorned beetles in Illinois and New York, Mediterranean and Mexican fruit flies throughout the southern United States, and the possibility for a foot and mouth disease incursion. The Committee notes that the Secretary of Agriculture has authority to declare emergencies and to use the resources of the Commodity Credit Corporation for the arrest and eradication of such threats to American agriculture. This system has served our country well for many years by granting the Secretary the power to make virtually unlimited efforts to eliminate emerging pest and disease problems before outbreaks expand and become unmanageable.    Domestic shrimping industry.--The Committee is aware that the domestic shrimping industry has suffered an extraordinary increase in imported shrimp caused by European tariffs and financial problems in many Asian nations. Shrimp imports have increased to over  million pounds per year, while prices have plummeted. Free-falling shrimp wholesale prices are causing significant problems to our domestic shrimping industry. The Committee will expect the Secretary of Agriculture to review this situation and report on possible solutions to this predicament.    Egg industry.--The Committee is aware of the economic problems facing the U.S. egg industry and expects the Department of Agriculture to work in developing programs to utilize spent hens and otherwise assist egg producers.    Productivity of the tree fruit industry.--The Committee believes the U.S. tree fruit industry is a vital part of the economy in many regions of this country, and its economic viability is seriously threatened by a downturn in profitability. To enhance its competitiveness, the Committee requests that U.S. Department of Agriculture consult with the U.S. tree fruit industry to develop, enhance and disseminate a range of new approaches and technologies, including: fruit genomics, fruit quality, precision agriculture applications, sensor technology, and intelligent and automated orchard and fruit handling management systems that will lower costs and improve fruit quality. The Committee requests that USDA develop a plan to address the tree fruit industry's needs and report its progress to the Committee no later than January , .    State Office Collocation.--The Committee continues to direct that any reallocation of resources related to the collocation of state offices scheduled for  and subsequent years is subject to the Committee's reprogramming procedures. The Committee notes that no such reprogramming requests have been received to date.    Farmers' Market at USDA Headquarters.--The Committee continues to support the operation of the Farmers' Market operating at USDA headquarters in Washington DC. Given that this site offers a unique opportunity as a demonstration project viewed by visitors and government officials, the Committee strongly urges the Department to develop the use of electronic benefit technology at this location, including the use of credit, ATM, and EBT cards.    Contracting.--The Committee is concerned that extensive use of contracting outside the Department for administrative and core mission activities may not yield the best cost benefit or the best customer benefit in terms of dealing with experienced career federal personnel. Customers of federal programs such as those administered by the Rural Development Services and the Farm Service Agency often have needs and circumstances that are not dealt with in the private sector. The Committee directs the Department to make cost comparisons of the use of private contractors with federal employee performance and to employ the most efficient organization process as described in OMB Circular A-. The Committee also directs the Department to solicit input from federal employees in agencies affected by contracting out in order to ensure the expertise of those employees is a part of any decision made by management. The Committee also directs the Department to report on its contracting out policies, including the agency budgets for contracting out, with its annual budget submission for fiscal year .    Food Safety Commission.--The Committee is aware that the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act included a provision which established a `Food Safety Commission' to make specific recommendations to enhance the food safety system, including a report to the President and Congress addressing the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the Commission, a summary of any other materials used by the Commission in the preparation of the report, and, if requested, a summary of the minority views of the Commission. Given continuing concerns about foodborne illness and the need to ensure the security of the U.S. food supply, the Committee urges the Secretary to commence establishment of the Food Safety Commission in fiscal year , and to include specific funding for its operation in the FY  Budget Request.    Cranberry acreage reserve program.--To the extent that any funds are provided for the Cranberry Acreage Reserve Program (established in Section  of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of ), easement purchases should: be limited to areas composed of both wetlands and buffer lands adjacent to the wetlands where the ratio of wetlands and buffer lands is consistent with the prevailing ratios in the cranberry cultivation operations in the region; prohibit cranberry production and development, other than that needed for recreational use or other non-cranberry agricultural use; maximize the reduction in the cranberry surplus while targeting smaller cranberry growing operations; be implemented in a manner that ensures a reasonable distribution of easement purchases among cranberry producing regions with higher and lower potential easement purchase prices. Priority should be given to easement purchases that include non-federal funds and preserve open space in environmentally sensitive areas."

The Committee directs the Chief Financial Officer, in conjunction with the Director of the National Finance Center, to report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate on the implementation of these funds by April , , and subsequently on September , .    The Committee has provided legislative language to allow the Department to transfer unobligated balances, discretionary and/or mandatory, to the Working Capital Fund for these same improvements and investments that the budget request included, and this appropriations bill is funding on a one-time basis. The Committee strongly encourages the Department to take advantage of this language, including the extended availability of funds until November , . This extended availability should allow the Department and the Administration to close it books, identify unobligated balances, and transfer these balances to the Working Capital Fund in accordance with the provision.    In addition, the Committee recommends a one-time, appropriation of  for the purchase of hardware and software, and for the implementation of remote mirroring technology as part of a Disaster Recovery plan.

1246,107-623 H.txt,    For Hazardous Materials Management,"    For Hazardous Materials Management, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and the same amount as the budget request."
1247,107-623 H.txt,    For Departmental Administration,"    For Departmental Administration, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and decrease of  below the budget request.    Mentor Protege Program.--The Committee is aware that USDA does not currently have a program to assist agriculturally-related businesses (mentors) in helping minority farmers, small disadvantaged businesses and women-owned small food producers (proteges) develop technical and business capabilities. The Committee expects the Department to establish within existing authorities a Mentor Protege Pilot program in specialty crop regions, including the State of Georgia, which would assist proteges in filling food commodity requirements. The Department should consider making grants to mentors--specifically fresh fruit and vegetable businesses which can identify markets for agricultural products of small, limited resource farmers--to assist in paying costs of technical assistance and training for these farmers."
1248,107-623 H.txt,    For the Outreach for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers Program,"    For the Outreach for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers Program, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and an increase of  above the budget request.     Office of the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations appropriation...................................."
1249,107-623 H.txt,    For the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations,"    For the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and decrease of  below the budget request.    Within  days from the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall notify the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the allocation of these funds by USDA agency, along with an explanation for the agency-by-agency distribution of the funds.    The Committee notes that for fiscal year , the notification on the allocation of these funds by USDA agency was received well beyond the `` days after enactment'' provision of the language. The Committee reminds the Secretary that this language was inserted in lieu of legislative language requiring a specific funding level to the agency accounts. The Committee urges the Secretary to meet the notification requirement set forth in this directive."
1250,107-623 H.txt,    For the Office of Communications,"    For the Office of Communications, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The Committee directs the Office of Communications to provide to the Committee on Appropriations, upon request, copies of any open source news material made available to USDA officials that is purchased, or otherwise obtained, using appropriated funds."
1251,107-623 H.txt,    For the Office of Inspector General (OIG),"    For the Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year , and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The Committee notes that the Office of Inspector General (OIG) will expend an estimated  staff years auditing the USDA  consolidated financial statements while the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) and agencies will only expend an estimated . staff years preparing these same statements. The Committee believes that this is an excessive amount of OIG oversight, and it expects OIG to reduce this level of audit oversight and transfer resources to investigative work. The Committee directs OIG to use commonly accepted norms of financial statement oversight to develop an audit plan, and to provide details of how OIG will implement that oversight level to the Committee within  days of enactment.    The Committee concurs with the OIG's decision to have independent auditors perform the financial statement audits for the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) and Rural Development programs (RD). Budget increases for independent audits are included in the Committee recommendations for FNS and RD and are offset with a decrease in the OIG appropriation. Any OIG contract administration or oversight costs for these contract audits should be kept to a minimum.    Increased funding for audit work on Forest Service programs is not included. The Committee believes that both OIG and contract audit work on Forest Service financial statements and the Fire Program should continue to be funded from appropriations provided to the Forest Service.    The Committee understands that the OIG is requiring USDA agencies with user fee programs to comply with certain ``full cost'' provisions of the Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standard No. , ``Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards.'' User fee programs are being required to calculate and charge for ``imputed unfunded pension and other retirement benefit costs'' which is in conflict with the respective user fee authorizing legislation. The Committee does not agree with this requirement and expects this requirement to be deleted unless the respective authorizing legislation is amended to specifically require those calculations and charges, or Congress enacts legislation that transfers these unfunded costs to all Federal government programs."
1252,107-623 H.txt,    For the Office of the General Counsel,"    For the Office of the General Counsel, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available in fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.  Office of the Under Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics appropriation...................................."
1253,107-623 H.txt,    For the Office of the Under Secretary for Research,"    For the Office of the Under Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The Committee notes that all minority-serving institutions play a positive role in advancing the many educational and research interests of American agriculture, including related concerns with homeland security. Furthermore, funding across a wider range of post-secondary institutions is important to the strength and effectiveness of homeland security. The Committee urges the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service and the Agricultural Research Service to take significant steps to increase outreach, cooperation, and engagement with minority-serving institutions--including  Colleges/ Universities and Tuskegee University,  Tribally-Controlled Colleges/Universities, and Hispanic Serving Institutions--in all areas, but especially as they develop and implement research programs and related defense of the nation's homeland and food supply."
1254,107-623 H.txt,    For the Economic Research Service,"    For the Economic Research Service, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    The Committee recommendation provides the full increase for the ERS portion of the Agricultural Resources Management Survey.    Veal.--The Committee is very concerned about the impact of veal imports on the domestic veal industry and the discrepancy in the treatment afforded milk replacer used in veal production, which may be imported into the United States tariff-free, while exports of domestically produced milk replacer are subject to a  percent tariff. The Economic Research Service of the Department of Agriculture is encouraged to complete a study within  days after the date of the enactment of this Act on these issues as well as a study of general trends in United States consumption of veal, domestic veal production and prices, and details of top veal production States and foreign sources of imported veal."
1255,107-623 H.txt,    For the National Agricultural Statistics Service,"    For the National Agricultural Statistics Service, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available in fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request.    Included in this amount is  for the Census of Agriculture. The Census of Agriculture collects and provides comprehensive data every five years on all aspects of the agricultural economy.    The budget year is the fourth year in a five-year funding cycle for the Census of Agriculture; Census funding needs are cyclical and the fourth year peak is due to data collection activities.    The Committee recommendation provides the full increase for the NASS portion of the Agricultural Resources Management Survey. The recommendation does not include the requested  increase for e-government activities."
1256,107-623 H.txt,    Salaries and expenses.--For salaries and expenses of the Agricultural Research Service,"    Salaries and expenses.--For salaries and expenses of the Agricultural Research Service, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and an increase of  above the budget request.    Acoustic technology.--The Committee recognizes the potential hazards posed by the reintroduction of sediment into the environment. The Committee provides an increase of  in fiscal year  for research to develop a high resolution acoustic sub-bottom profiling system for use in flood-control dams at the ARS National Sedimentation Laboratory at Oxford, Mississippi. This research will efficiently assess the effects of sediment movement on a dam's ability to regulate flood waters.    Advanced animal vaccines.--The USDA estimates that the annual monetary loss as a result of cattle and swine diarrheal disease is  million in the U.S. alone. Food borne pathogens cause between . million and  million cases of human disease and , deaths annually. The Committee provides an increase of  in fiscal year  for expanded research on advanced animal vaccines and diagnostic applications currently carried out jointly by ARS, the University of Connecticut, and the University of Missouri.    Animal waste research.--The Committee supports the need for additional research to find solutions to reduce or eliminate risks to the environment and human health caused by animal waste. The Committee provides an increase of  in fiscal year  to support this research at Florence, SC; Madison, WI; Fayetteville, AR; Clay Center, NE and Bushland, TX. In addition the Committee provides an increase of  over fiscal year  for farm and watershed research and monitoring of manure nutrients, pathogens, and emissions at ARS laboratories at Ames, IA; Athens, GA; and Kimberly, ID.

The Center assists researchers and others responsible for the care of laboratory animals with important information to enable them to comply with the humane standards established under the Animal Welfare Act. The Committee provides an increase of  in fiscal year  to support animal welfare activities.    Aquaculture density research.--A growing aquaculture venture, particularly in Florida, is clam production. The State of Florida promotes aquaculture and specifically clam culture by leasing sovereignty-submerged land. However, very little is known on the ecological limits of large scale clam culture. The Committee provides an increase of  in fiscal year  for research critical to the sustained growth of the clam industry.    Barley food health.--The Committee recognizes the need to investigate the benefits of barley foods to human health. The Committee provides an increase of  in fiscal year  for investigation and documentation of the benefits of barley foods to human health, which are requisites to expanded domestic and international markets of barley.

Biomass feedstock research.--To improve the quality and quantity of agricultural feedstock for production of energy and biobased products, the Committee provides additional funding of  for each of the following ARS laboratories: Albany, CA; Athens, GA; Lincoln, NE; St. Paul and Madison, WI.    Biotechnology Research and Development Corporation (BRDC).--BRDC is a uniquely successful public/private partnership dedicated to promoting technology development and commercialization of agricultural technology. The success of this investment can be measured by the large number of patents and technology licenses of inventions sponsored through BRDC. The Committee does not agree with the budget request to terminate this research and directs that this program be maintained at the fiscal year  level.    Biotechnology risk assessment.--The Committee supports the need to develop technologies to provide tissue-specific expansion of genes for resistance to fungal pathogens and reduction of mycotoxins in maize. The Committee provides an increase of  in fiscal year  to carry out this important research at ARS' National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research.    Bovine genetics.--The Committee supports the research program on biotechnology and genetics in cattle jointly carried out by ARS, the University of Connecticut and the University of Illinois. This program utilizes advanced research technologies to improve efficiency of clones and establish cell lines from elite cows and bulls for cloning. The Committee provides an increase of  to expand these studies in fiscal year .    Cereal disease research.--Wheat and barley research conducted at the ARS Cereal Disease Laboratory, St. Paul, Minnesota is invaluable to the economic viability of these industries. The Committee recognizes the importance of maintaining scientific expertise at this laboratory and provides an increase of  in fiscal year  to support priority research at this laboratory.    Chloroplast genetic engineering research.--The Committee supports the important research advances at the University of Central Florida (UCF) on chloroplast genetic engineering. The research team at UCF has internationally recognized expertise in this field of research. The Committee provides an increase of  in fiscal year  for collaborative research with the University of Central Florida on the efficient and effective means of genetically-engineering chloroplast to increase the efficiency of photosynthesis as a key component of agricultural production.

Accomplishments.--The Committee strongly objects to the Department's budget recommendations to terminate important research programs funded by the Congress. As stipulated in this report, certain research programs directed by this Committee proposed for reduction are fully restored. The Committee will continue to exercise its constitutionally-derived responsibility to fund critical and priority research programs important to the food and agriculture industry. The Congress is uniquely capable of making prudent decisions on program and resources based upon the information and justification expressed by the industry, consumers, and environmental and other stakeholders. The Committee recognizes the many and diverse issues confronting farmers, ranchers, consumers, and other interest groups. The research funded by this Committee is directed toward solving problems, both short- and long-term, to enhance the growth of the U.S. economy and international trade, preserve the environment, and promote the health and well-being of our citizenry. The following selected examples reflect the merit and successes of projects recently funded by Congress, as detailed justification for the Committee's Recommendation to continue these research programs:Pullman, WA--Malignant Catarrhal Fever    Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) is a severe disease of certain domestic and wild ruminants such as cattle, bison and deer. ARS, in collaboration with Washington State University (WSU), has developed the first monoclonal antibody-based serological test for MCF antibody. ARS has assisted the United Nations in establishment of MCF diagnostic testing capability. ARS has identified a new herpesvirus causing classic MCF in white-tailed deer and is investigating MCF in bison, a recently emerging, and serious obstacle for bison producers of North America.Cheyenne, WY--Rangeland Resources Research    More than  million acres of rangelands located in the western United States have contributed to the environmental, economic, and social well being of the Nation. A series of field studies, conducted in cooperation with Colorado State University, has quantified parameters and features that affect infiltration and runoff on rangelands. An analysis of the carbon and nitrogen compounds of a sagebrush-grass range site has revealed that soil nitrate-nitrogen is significantly higher in heavily grazed ``poor'' condition pastures than in moderately grazed ``good'' condition pastures.Phoenix, AZ--Aflatoxin in Cotton    This project has developed the manufacturing process carried out by the Arizona Cotton Research and Protection Council to increase from laboratory scale to production of , lb batches of fungal spores from non-toxin producing strains. This enabled the treatment of , acres of cotton in AZ in  which prevents the contamination of cottonseed with aflatoxin. As the manufacturing process is optimized it is planned to address previously intractable problems on the biology and ecology of aflatoxin producing fungi.Auburn, AL--Vaccines for Control of Fish Diseases    ARS scientists at Auburn, Alabama, lead the world in the development of vaccines to prevent fish diseases, as follows:     Invented, patented, and transferred (licensed) the first modified live-fish vaccine. This vaccine, marketed as AQUAVAC-ESC, prevents a major bacterial disease that causes enteric septicemia (ESC) in channel catfish. Intervet, Inc., Millsboro, Delaware, sold out their ESC vaccine in  at  million doses.     Developed and patented a killed vaccine for control of the bacterium, Streptococcus iniae, a major disease of wild and cultured fish species worldwide. Intervet, Inc., plans to distribute the streptococcal vaccine formulation in Asia.     Developed a modified live vaccine against Flavobacterium columnare, another major bacterial pathogen of catfish and other fish.New Orleans, LA--Formosan Subterranean Termites--A One Billion Dollar"

Pesticide Data Program.--The Committee provides  for the Pesticide Data Program (PDP), an increase of  of which not less than  of the increase, shall be added to the existing funding for the drinking water initiative. The PDP is responsible for collecting data on current pesticides for the Environmental Protection Agency, and providing input into the need for research on safer alternatives to existing pesticides. It is vital that the PDP provide data on real world usage. Lack of reliable scientific data is the single biggest fault of the registration process. Currently, only minimal collection occurs in the area of drinking water, yet its impact on consumers and the registration process is significant.    Microbiological Data Program.--The Committee is aware of continued concerns that have been raised by interested stakeholders regarding scientific and policy issues surrounding the implementation of Microbiological Data Program. The Committee encourages USDA, prior to the implementation of the current funding provided for this program, to work with stakeholders such as the newly appointed Department of Agriculture Fruit and Vegetable Advisory Committee to ensure that an appropriate framework is established for addressing the scientific and policy concerns that have been raised. The Committee strongly encourages the Department to certify that microbiological data can be produced that will be helpful in reducing the occurrence of harmful pathogens on fresh produce prior to further implementation of the program.    Farmers' Market Feasibility.--The Committee strongly encourages AMS to provide financial or technical assistance to study the feasibility of and develop plans for a regional farmers market in Loudoun County, Virginia, as well as a Portland, Oregon, Public Market.    Multi-State Farmers' Market Demonstration.--The Committee strongly encourages the USDA to establish a multi-state Farmers' Market Demonstration Program linking markets in Toledo and Cleveland (OH), and Detroit, Michigan, with specialty crop producers in southern states, including Mississippi, and North Carolina, and South Carolina."

1267,107-623 H.txt,    For the Marketing Agreements and Orders Program,"    For the Marketing Agreements and Orders Program, the Committee provides a transfer from section  funds of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and the same as the budget request.    The Committee urges the Department to pay closer attention to problems of oversupply and low prices caused by imports, and to use its purchasing power under Section  to even out the markets. In addition, the Committee encourages the Department to purchase at least as many fresh and processed apples, and as much apple juice this year as it did in calendar year .    The Committee notes that Section  of the  Farm Bill requires USDA to purchase not less than  million of fruits, vegetables, and other specialty crops, and encourages the Secretary to exceed historical Section  purchase levels during implementation of Section .    Juice Blends.--The Committee recognizes the important role fruit juice and juice blends plays in children's diets. In the past the Agricultural Marketing Service has conducted pilot programs where a grapefruit and cranberry juice blend was offered through the food and nutrition program. The Committee urges the Department to continue its work with the Texas Department of Agriculture, the Florida Department of Citrus, and cranberry producers in developing and testing juice blends for use in Food and Nutrition Programs, and other commodity procurement programs. The Committee requests a report from the Department by April , , on the progress of these efforts."

1269,107-623 H.txt,    For Grain Inspection,"    For Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration, the Committee provides  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year , and an increase of  above the budget request.    Production Verification Protocols Pilot.--The Committee understands that the Secretary intends to implement a process verification program for grain production and handling for the purposes of establishing controls for regulated seed varieties, and to augment traditional grain marketing. The Committee encourages the Department to establish a cooperative relationship with the Missouri, Iowa, and Illinois Corn Growers Associations, and provides  to conduct a pilot program for development of production protocols.    Packer Ownership.--The Committee is very concerned about the economic impacts of Meat Packer Control, Feeding or Ownership of Livestock, and other captive supply issues, on local communities. The potential for shifts in livestock production, and the related shifts in live grain markets, for example, can impact local tax bases, as well as livestock and grain prices under Packer Ownership of Livestock. These types of swings can be significant to communities, and to independent producer viability.    The Committee is persuaded that the time has come for an earnest and objective study of the market and economic implications of laws that would prohibit meat packers from owning, feeding or substantially controlling livestock. The study should utilize expertise beyond traditional agricultural economics, including, but not limited to, industrial organization expertise and business school or business consulting expertise.    Accordingly, the Committee directs the Secretary to conduct a study of the issues surrounding a ban on Packer Ownership, particularly as to the economic impacts on the United States as a whole, and on individual states. The study shall include, but not be limited to, examination of alternative procurement and transfer methods for livestock in the farm to retail chain, including producers that participate with packers in vertically-integrated livestock or meat production; agricultural credit for livestock producers; livestock and grain prices and the quality and consistency of meat products and livestock under a ban. The Committee provides a total of  to remain available until expended, for this study. The Secretary shall report the findings of the study to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within twenty-four months of enactment of this Act."

County Offices.--The Committee is concerned about any Departmental plans to close FSA county offices at a time when the FSA office network is essential to helping farmers address critical economic and environmental issues. The Committee reiterates its strong view that no county office closure or consolidation should occur except in those locations for which closures and relocations are supported by rigorous analysis to ensure actions are cost effective, and that services available to the public will not be reduced.    Farm bill implementation costs.--The Committee does not recommend additional funding for implementation costs of the recently enacted farm bill (Public Law -), because no formal budget request for such costs has been submitted.    Location of Commodity Sales to the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC).--The Committee continues last year's directive to the Department to increase its outreach to producers and grain traders so as to increase the pool of CCC-eligible vendors for any commodity sale. In particular, the Committee expects the Department to make special efforts in Ohio and other Great Lakes States to increase sales and shipments from these areas.    Wisconsin ginseng industry.--The Committee notes that Wisconsin ginseng growers have suffered four successive years of excessive rain which has severely damaged the crop and the ability of growers to continue to operate. In addition, government subsidies to Canadian ginseng growers have made it increasingly difficult for American ginseng growers to compete in international markets. The Committee urges the Department to work closely with the Wisconsin ginseng industry and ensure that the industry is receiving all the assistance to which it is entitled under federal farm programs.    Wisconsin windbreaks.--Counties in Central Wisconsin have requested that the Farm Service Agency allow cost-sharing on the plastic mulch that is utilized in the planting of field windbreaks. At the present time under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) windbreaks are cost-shared, but the plastic mulch is not. This plastic mulch increases survival rates to % or more compared to survival rates of %-% without the mulch. A request to change the rules through the State Technical Advisory Committee was denied on grounds that an area with  inches of rainfall or more per year does not require mulch. However, moisture conservation is only part of the need. The major benefit of this mulch is that it eliminates competition by weeds and other unwanted species for moisture and nutrients, which provides the optimum conditions for windbreak establishment and growth. FSA has indicated that it will evaluate expanding its cost-share policies to include plastic mulch. In light of the benefits associated with the use of plastic mulch that is utilized in the planting of field windbreaks, the Committee urges FSA to expand its cost-share policies to allow CRP participants to receive cost-share for plastic mulch when used for weed control purposes.    Soft red wheat.--The Committee is aware that farmers all over the country may have been financially disadvantaged by the Secretary's decision to make the new county loan rates effective for this year's winter wheat crop. The timing of the Secretary's decision has had significant impacts on soft red wheat procedures in the United States. The Committee urges the Secretary to postpone the effective date of these changes until the next crop year as it applies to soft red wheat.    Tree Assistance Program.--The Committee recognizes that beginning in January , fruit growers throughout Michigan and several other states have incurred substantial economic and tree losses due to fireblight. These growers are in need for assistance to defray costs of replanting trees destroyed by fireblight. The Committee further notes that the Tree Assistance Program, which reimburses growers for costs for replacing destroyed trees, was reauthorized in the Farm Security Act of , and urges the Secretary to consider obligating funds to the Tree Assistance Program in the amount necessary to reimburse for costs, going back to January , of farmers who had replanted trees as a result of fireblight."

Electronic Benefit Transfer.--The Committee recommendation includes language to allow funds to be used for WIC electronic benefit transfer (EBT) systems and sets the authorized level of infrastructure funding at  which includes funding to develop EBT systems.    Farmers' Market Nutrition Program.--The Committee recommendation includes  for the Farmers' Market Nutrition Program; the budget request included no funding for this purpose. The Committee strongly urges the Secretary to make these funds available as soon as possible after enactment, as farmers' markets are seasonal and the Committee wants WIC participants and farmers to fully benefit. The Committee notes that, in addition to the recommended amount, funds made available in fiscal year  by P.L. -, Section , and not spent in that year, are available for this program.    Infant Formula.--The Committee notes that Federal regulations set a maximum monthly amount for infant formula to be issued to WIC participants for ready-to-feed formula, liquid concentrate and powder. For powder, the maximum is  pounds, or  dry ounces. However, because of the available can sizes, a WIC client cannot reach that maximum. The Committee is concerned that infants in the WIC program receive proper nutrition, and directs the Department to provide a report to the Committee within  days of enactment that includes the Department's recommendation concerning providing flexibility to state WIC agencies, by allowing rounding up to the next whole can, or by other means, so that clients can receive the full authorized amount of formula.    WIC Food Prescription Package.--The Committee notes that the WIC food prescription package has changed little since . The Committee is concerned that the food package reflect current nutrition research, be consistent with the Dietary Guidelines, include fruits and vegetables, and allow for food substitutions to accommodate cultural eating patterns or allergies. At the FNS appropriations hearing, the Department stated that the proposed rule to revise the WIC food package was in Department clearance and publication was expected in early fall . The Committee expects this deadline to be met, and requests quarterly updates on the status of the rule until a final rule is published.    WIC Vendor Practices.--The Committee supports efforts to reduce fraud in the WIC program, and its funding recommendation includes  for the evaluation of WIC vendor practices.    Blended fruit juices.--The Secretary is directed to clarify to all WIC state and regional directors that blended  percent fruit juices are eligible WIC food products; further, the Secretary should emphasize that blended  percent fruit juices should be objectively evaluated by the states, on an equal basis to other eligible products, for inclusion in the approved WIC food lists."
1311,107-623 H.txt,    For the Food Stamp Program,"    For the Food Stamp Program, the Committee provides  an increase of  above the amount available in fiscal year  and  above the budget request. The total amount includes  for a contingency reserve in fiscal year ;  for nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico and American Samoa; and  for The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP).    The Committee recommendation is above the budget request due to an additional  in mandatory spending for TEFAP and block grants for Puerto Rico and American Samoa as directed in P.L. -, Sections  and .    Food Stamp Quality Assurance.--The Secretary has broad authority to adjust quality control claims against States. The interest of this Committee is to see that this authority is used in a manner that is fair, while protecting the integrity of the Food Stamp Program. The Committee is aware that the Secretary of Agriculture has exercised this authority to adjust fiscal year  quality control claims, taking into account disproportionate numbers of earners and immigrants when making adjustments to the State liabilities. The Committee appreciates the Secretary using her authority in this manner and encourages her to make appropriate use of this authority in the future."

The recommended funding level for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) is . This level will fund administrative costs at the level authorized in P.L. -, allow CSFP to rebuild its depleted food inventory, and allow caseload to expand to meet state demands. It is the Committee's understanding that no funds will carry over from fiscal year  into fiscal year .    The Committee has included  for administration of TEFAP, the same amount available in fiscal year  and the same amount as the budget request. These funds may be used for administration purposes or for food costs at the discretion of the states.    Seniors Farmers' Market Program.--The Committee notes that it funded the Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition Program from this account in fiscal year . However, Public Law -, Section , directs mandatory funding for this program from funds available to the Commodity Credit Corporation. The funding level is  for fiscal year .    Food Distribution and Preservation.--The Committee believes that there is an abundant and affordable supply of surplus foods, but the lack of distribution and transportation capacity can limit the program's effectiveness. The Committee urges the Department to support programs that can expand food distribution, particularly for perishable produce that may require special equipment. The Department is encouraged to work with and support community service organizations for this purpose."
1313,107-623 H.txt,    For the Food Donations Programs the Committee provides an appropriation of  for Pacific Island Assistance,"    For the Food Donations Programs the Committee provides an appropriation of  for Pacific Island Assistance, a decrease of  below the amount available for fiscal year , and the same amount as the budget request.    The Committee recommendation accepts the budget proposal to transfer the Nutrition Services Incentive Program to the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration on Aging. This will consolidate existing elderly feeding programs, allowing for more efficient management. The Committee expects that the Administration on Aging would continue to purchase agricultural commodities for elderly feeding programs through the Department of Agriculture at or above the current funding level, benefiting both the feeding programs and producers.    Nutrition Program for the Elderly.--The Committee also specifically notes that in the past, nearly  per year has been provided in this bill for the Nutrition Program for the Elderly. As the move to the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration on Aging, is carried out, the Committee expects that these funds be used solely for meals and that none of it be transferred to fund any other services, nor should state matching requirements be applied to the program. Finally, the Committee expects that the ability of states to request commodities in lieu of cash be retained, even once funding is transferred to the Administration on Aging."
1314,107-623 H.txt,    For Food Program Administration,"    For Food Program Administration, the Committee has provided  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year , and a decrease of  below the budget request.

Currency fluctuations.--The Committee provides bill language permitting the Department to maintain up to  solely for the purpose of offsetting international currency fluctuations.    U.S. commodities.--The Committee continues to believe that commodity assistance, including monetization, is a vital tool to help alleviate the needs of recipients, and a prudent way to help move commodities that are in surplus and urgently needed. In any review of international commodity assistance, including section , the Committee expects that its prior directives on the matter be given full consideration. Further, while any change in Executive Administration will routinely delay decisions ordinarily made in the normal course of business, the Committee remains concerned that decisions with respect to commodity assistance are being made too late in the year to be of maximum value. The Committee directs the Department to develop a system for making these decisions no later than February  of each year, and to report to the Committee on the steps taken to implement this system.    Surplus Commodities.--The Committee understands that the CCC is currently holding a stockpile of non-fat dry milk exceeding  million pounds. The Committee believes it will benefit U.S. dairy farmers and taxpayers if this product is used to meet the nutrition demands of hungry people throughout the world. As such, the Committee encourages the Department to use this surplus to make humanitarian donations utilizing organizations such as Dairy Relief, Incorporated, a dairy industry funded non-profit organization, and other eligible humanitarian organizations.    The Committee encourages the Department to cooperate with the South Carolina Export Consortium efforts to expand export markets.    The Committee strongly encourages the Department to implement a data storage infrastructure to provide for the remote mirroring of geo-spatial information and applications for the Production Estimates & Crop Assessment Division to achieve a Continuance of Operations capability.    The Committee expects the Department to adhere to the statutory requirement that . million metric tons of food aid under the program is to be used for nonemergency purposes. The Committee also expects that its previous statements in the fiscal  supplemental appropriations report regarding the importance of continuing the section (b) assistance program along with maintaining contact between USDA and Private Voluntary Organizations will continue to be followed. Finally, the committee expects the Department to maintain maximum flexibility with respect to the monetization of commodities and the use of monetized proceeds. The Department's report to the committee regarding the accomplishments of monetization sets a standard that should be continued.    The McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program was established with the expectation that after a reasonable period of time, the local Private Voluntary Organizations or governments which sponsor the program would reach a point at which they would be able to continue the effort beyond the period of contribution of resources by the United States. The Committee urges the Department to undertake appropriate planning for such transitions, including efforts to open these new markets to additional commercial sales of American commodities. The Department is directed to provide a report regarding these efforts and what resources might be needed in advance of the fiscal  appropriation hearings."

1318,107-623 H.txt,    For the Food and Drug Administration,"    For the Food and Drug Administration, the Committee provides a total direct appropriation of  for salaries and expenses and makes available an additional  in fees collected under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, for a total of . This is an increase of  above the total amount available in fiscal year  and a decrease of  below the budget request. The decrease is due solely to a change in estimated revenues from prescription drug user fees, which are fully funded at the authorized level.    The Committee recommendation fully funds the budget authority request for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including  for counter-terrorism activities. Increases are recommended, as requested, for the generic drug program, activities related to medical errors and adverse events, and pay costs.    The Committee notes that the recommended funding level includes  for FDA public and legislative affairs activities. The Committee does not support the transfer of these functions to the Department of Health and Human Services, as proposed in the budget request.    The recommended funding level includes a total of  for costs associated with establishing the Unified Financial Management System (UFMS), a Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) initiative, including costs for FDA to maintain and improve its legacy systems. The Committee recommendation fully funds the request; any additional costs to FDA for this purpose, either direct or by transfer, are subject to approval by the Committee. The Committee requires DHHS to provide a complete briefing to the Committee on the business case for UFMS by July , , to include the system requirements that will be imposed upon participating agencies, the costs of meeting those requirements, and outyear cost estimates for the system. Further, the Committee requests quarterly updates on the progress of the system, its ability to meet agency needs, and updated cost estimates for implementation.    Generic Drug Education Activities.--The Committee expects the FDA to continue funding generic drug education activities at not less than . The Committee understands that the agency is conducting studies and developing continuing education programs for physicians and pharmacists. However, the Committee strongly believes that consumers should also be included in generic drug education efforts by the FDA, and expects increased consumer education in fiscal year .    Generic Drug Program.--The recommended funding level includes a  increase for the generic drugs program, and also funds pay cost increases within the program, as requested. The Committee expects that the entire amount recommended for the generic drugs program be applied solely to activities of the generic drugs program, and not transferred to any other activity within or outside of FDA. The Committee is aware that the fiscal year  budget request for the generic drug program supports a performance level of reviewing  percent of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) within six months after submission of an application. The FDA should review  percent of ANDAs within the statutory timeframe for generic drug review. Therefore, the Committee directs the Commissioner to provide a plan to the Committee to eliminate this performance gap. The plan should include detailed estimates of the resources needed in the generic drug program, including field personnel, to meet statutory timeframes for drug application review and statutory inspection requirements, and infrastructure or technological upgrades required. The plan should be submitted to the Committee within  days of enactment.    Genetically Engineered Foods.--The Committee notes that the Food and Drug Administration proposed a rule on premarket notification of food that has been genetically engineered or made of ingredients that have been genetically engineered. In addition FDA published a draft guidance for companies that wish to label their products to indicate whether they have been genetically engineered. FDA is encouraged to finalize voluntary labeling guidance for companies to indicate whether the foods are prepared with or without the use of genetic engineering.    Import Tracking.--The Committee directs FDA to report to the Committee on updates and developments made to the Operational and Administrative System for Import Support (OASIS) system and import tracking, and any additional system or financial requirements to provide current, accurate data and to link into other federal import-related databases.    Intravenous Immune Globulin.--The Committee notes the importance of expedited review for intravenous immune globulin (IGIV). The Committee encourages the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to allocate adequate resources to the Office of Blood Research and Review to promote the timely review of new IGIV products that have been submitted for licensure under the FDA's revised IGIV clinical trial protocol.    Juice HACCP Implementation.--The Committee understands that in overseeing the juice industry's implementation of the juice Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) rule, FDA is delaying initial HACCP inspections until the draft Juice HACCP Hazards and Controls Guide is released and until FDA investigators have been trained to conduct juice HACCP inspections. The Committee urges the agency to allow sufficient time and information sharing from the date of publication of the guide to scheduling of regulatory inspections. The Committee encourages FDA in its plans to make initial inspections educational in nature in order to counsel juice manufacturers on the adequacy of their HACCP plans and implementation of such plans, reserving regulatory actions for situations in which a safety issue is present.    Listeria Risk Assessment.--The Committee is encouraged by the progress FDA and USDA have made in evaluating the risk of listeriosis in ready to eat products and in developing a plan for the reduction of risk through science-based policy. The Committee strongly urges the FDA and USDA to complete the listeria risk assessment and begin work on revising the listeria action plan. The Committee directs the FDA and USDA to rely solely on scientific data in their policy development process.    Medical Device Program.--The Committee recommendation fully funds the medical device program, as requested. In addition, the Committee notes that the prevalence of combination products should be taken into account in determinations about program resources. The Committee encourages the agency to fully integrate its programs and allocate resources so that combination products, in particular devices that require consultation by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, are reviewed in a timely manner. The Committee requests a report regarding the prevalence of combination products and the review times of those products as opposed to standard products by May , .    Medical Device Review.--The Committee is deeply concerned about the impact that delays in medical device application review have on Americans' health. In last year's Committee Report, the Committee directed that FDA provide updates of its medical device review performance, as compared to statutory requirements for application decisions, to the Committee in January and July . The Committee has yet to receive the January update, and was not able to obtain an informative answer to a related question submitted to the agency at its fiscal year  appropriations hearing. The Committee directs the Commissioner to provide a plan to the Committee to eliminate the medical device performance gap. The plan should include detailed estimates of the resources needed in the device program, including field personnel, to meet statutory timeframes for application review and statutory inspection requirements, and infrastructure or technological upgrades required. The plan should be submitted to the Committee within  days of enactment. The Committee notes that this information is critical to funding decisions on increases or decreases to budget items.    National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS).--The Committee remains interested in the function and administration of NARMS, and notes that it has not yet received the report it requested regarding NARMS, due May , . The Committee directs FDA to provide the report, as detailed in the fiscal year  conference report within  days of enactment.    Test Method Evaluation.--The Committee directs that the agency continue the fiscal year  level of funding for FDA to continue its contract with New Mexico State University's Physical Science Laboratory to conduct method evaluation of rapid testing methods of fresh fruits and vegetables for microbial contamination.    Office of Women's Health.--The Committee strongly supports FDA's efforts to improve gender-based research, in part by encouraging women's participation in clinical trials and tracking demographic data about such participation. The Committee directs that FDA continue, at a minimum, the fiscal year  level of funding for the Office of Women's Health and report to the Committee the agency's progress in developing an agency-wide data set focused on women's health activities before the fiscal year  appropriations hearing.    Vaccine Review.--The Committee is aware that clinical testing of vaccines, including candidate HIV vaccines, requires careful review and oversight by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Review (CBER), and notes that there is particular urgency for expediting clinical trials for HIV vaccines, as well as vaccines for other serious illnesses, without compromising safety. The Committee urges the agency to develop a feasibility plan for a Fast Track program to facilitate the awarding of Investigational New Drug status to new vaccine candidates. The Committee directs FDA to report on progress toward implementing this program by March , .    Shellfish Safety.--The Committee expects that FDA will continue its work with the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Commission (ISSC) to promote educational and research activities related to shellfish safety in general, and Vibrio vulnificus in particular. The Committee directs the use of  for this effort from within sums provided for food safety. In addition, the Committee understands that FDA's Office of Seafood has a memorandum of understanding with ISSC to work on assuring the safety and quality of shellfish, including regulation development when needed. The Committee directs that FDA continue this work with the ISSC, and that FDA continue to devote not less than  to these efforts.    Training.--The Committee recognizes the challenge FDA faces in training  new field hires for food-related counter-terrorism activities. The Committee understands that the Agency goal is for new field personnel to become functional in targeted operations within three months of the time they come on board, with additional training in the following nine months. The Committee directs FDA to report to the Committee, regarding its plans to adequately ensure that new inspection personnel are trained for duties in inspecting for both unintentional and intentional adulterates to food.    Drug Patent Listing.--The Committee understands that in May  the Bureau of Competition and Policy Planning Staff of the Federal Trade Commission submitted a Citizen Petition to the FDA seeking specific guidance as to what patents may appropriately be listed in the Orange Book. The Committee is extremely concerned that the FDA has not responded to the FTC's request. Therefore, the Committee directs that within six months of enactment: (i) the FDA issue and publish in the Federal Register a final guidance for industry that provides clarification regarding the patent information submission requirements of sections (b)() and (c)() of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,  U.S.C. Sec. Sec. (b)(), (c)(), and the implementing regulation,  C.F.R. ., including, but not limited to, clarification regarding the type of patents that may and may not be submitted for listing in the Orange Book; and (ii) the FDA issue a final response to the Citizen Petition, which shall be submitted to FDA's Dockets Management Branch for public dissemination.    Foodborne Illness Information.--The Committee supports efforts of the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to work together through FoodNet to improve national data on the incidence of foodborne illness. The Committee is particularly interested in studies that would determine the proportion of cases of bacterial pathogens, such as E. coli O:H, Salmonella, Listeria, and Campylobacter, attributable to meat, poultry, eggs, seafood, fruits, and vegetables. The Committee requests a summary of planned, ongoing, or completed case-control studies before the fiscal year  appropriations hearings.    Ginseng.--The Committee notes the Section  of P.L. - states, in part: ``(A) the term ginseng may only be considered to be a common or usual name (or part thereof) for any herb or herbal ingredient derived from the plant classified within the genus Panax; and (B) only labeling of or advertising for herbs or herbal ingredients classified within that genus may include the term ``ginseng''.'' Despite this, a product labeled ``siberian ginseng,'' which is, in fact, not ginseng and is unrelated to ginseng, is being sold in U.S. health food stores in competition with ginseng. ``Siberian ginseng'' is not an herb; it is correctly known as Eleutherococcus senticosus. Under the provisions of Section  of P.L. -, this product cannot be labeled and sold as ginseng. The Committee expects the Food and Drug Administration to take all appropriate action to expeditiously enforce Section  of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in regard in ginseng labeling.    Office of Drug Safety.--The Committee has received assurance that, at the recommended funding level for fiscal year , the Office of Drug Safety will receive at least a five million dollar increase over its fiscal year  funding level.    Ephedra Products.--The Committee commends FDA for its recent statement that adverse event reports (AERs) regarding dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids do not alone provide a scientific basis for assessing the safety of these products. Additionally, the Committee agrees that the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)-sponsored comprehensive review of the scientific data is the appropriate response to possible concerns raised by adverse event reports. The Committee further understands that the National Institutes of Health will use the review to guide an expanded research effort on ephedrine alkaloids, and that FDA will be guided by the review in regulatory discussions on ephedra products. The Committee urges that following publication of this review, a dialogue take place between FDA and industry to determine any necessary actions or decisions regarding ephedra products, including development of a standard label of warnings and contraindications.    Juice Labeling.--The Committee is concerned that labeling on a number of beverage products may lead consumers to believe they are purchasing orange juice when the actual content of orange juice is negligible. The Committee directs the FDA to review the labeling requirements for products that claim to be orange juice when the orange juice content is  percent or less. The Committee requests a report from FDA by April , , regarding its recommendation to create new labeling guidelines, specific to this issue, to avoid consumer confusion.    Food Allergies.--The Committee is concerned about the incidence of food allergies, and notes that scientists and the public are increasingly concerned about the possibility of new food ingredients causing allergic reactions. While the FDA encourages careful evaluation of new proteins in genetically engineered foods, it has given less scrutiny to other food ingredients, such as whole new foods, such as kiwifruit, and mycoprotein (processed fungus). The Committee requests that the FDA, with input from the National Institutes of Health and other agencies it believes appropriate, review its practices on allergenicity and develop a comprehensive and consistent policy for evaluating novel foods and ingredients for potential allergenicity, including the types of tests that would be appropriate for evaluating different types of ingredients.    Building International Regulatory Capacity.--The Committee recognizes the need to expand regulatory capacity in low and middle income countries to facilitate local consideration of clinical trials of HIV and other vaccines and therapies. The Committee encourages the FDA to provide technical assistance to regulatory bodies in other countries to assist them in developing their own regulatory capacity. The Committee also supports continued efforts at international regulatory harmonization.    Dietary Supplement Study.--The Committee commends the Food and Drug Administration for having signed in September  a two-year contract with the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies to develop a framework for evaluating the safety of dietary supplements and apply it to six dietary supplements. The Committee encourages the FDA to continue this contract into fiscal year  and, if possible, to increase the number of dietary supplements to be evaluated by the Institute of Medicine.    Blood Safety and Adequacy.--The Committee is aware of several factors that have affected the nation's blood supply, including a recently implemented FDA deferral policy which restricts eligibility of blood donors who have traveled or lived in Europe or the U.K. because of the theoretical risk of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. The Committee is concerned about existing blood shortages and the possibility of increasingly severe shortages in the future because of the elimination of blood donors, confusion about donor criteria, and the loss of up to  percent of the U.S. military donor base. The Committee understands that additional FDA donor restrictions will become effective October , .    Maintaining an adequate blood supply is critical for the nation's public health and is essential for national preparedness in the event of public health emergencies. The Committee urges the FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services to address this issue and consider the potential need for modification of donor deferral criteria or other measures if serious blood shortages continue.    Recommendations by activity.--The Committee recommends that of the total amount provided: ()  shall be for the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition; ()  shall be for the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research; ()  shall be for the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research; ()  shall be for the Center for Veterinary Medicine; ()  shall be for the Center for Devices and Radiological Health; ()  shall be for the Office of Regulatory Affairs; ()  shall be for the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR); ()  shall be for Rent and Related activities, other than the amounts paid to the General Services Administration; ()  shall be for payments to the General Services Administration for rent and related costs; and ()  shall be for other activities, including the Office of the Commissioner; the Office of Senior Associate Commissioner; the Office of International and Constituent Relations; the Office of Policy, Legislation and Planning; the Office of Management and Systems; the Office of Chief Counsel; and central services for these offices. Funds may be transferred from one specified activity to another with the prior approval of the Committee."
1319,107-623 H.txt,    For Buildings and Facilities of the Food and Drug Administration,"    For Buildings and Facilities of the Food and Drug Administration, the Committee provides an appropriation of  decrease of  below the amount available for fiscal year  and the same amount as the budget request.    The decrease in funding in this account is primarily due to the completion of the funding for construction of the Los Angeles regional laboratory. The funding in this account is directed toward repairs and improvements to existing facilities."
1320,107-623 H.txt,    For the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,"    For the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Committee provides an appropriation of  an increase of  above the amount available for fiscal year  and the same as the budget request.    Pay Parity.--The Committee is aware that Public Law - contained a provision (Section ) authorizing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to pay employees at a rate comparable to employees of any agency included in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of . The Committee encourages the agency to submit a budget proposal that includes resources dedicated to pay parity under the aforementioned authority.    Transaction fee.--The President's budget proposed a transaction fee of  on commodity futures and options contracts to be available for CFTC activities. Such a transaction fee is not authorized to be collected. Therefore, the Committee recommendation does not assume revenue from the fee. The Committee is concerned that the fee, although neither authorized nor received by the Congress as part of a legislative proposal, was included as revenue in the President's budget. In effect, the fee proposal created a  cost to the Committee to maintain CFTC operations. The Committee notes that this bill includes a General Provision, Section , that prohibits funds from being used to prepare a budget submission to Congress that assumes reductions from the previous year's budget due to user fee proposals unless the submission also identifies spending reductions which should occur if the user fees are not enacted.    Reporting Requirements.--The Committee directs that up to  million of this increase be provided to the Inspector General to conduct a thorough investigation into suspicious activities or transactions involving Enron, its subsidiaries, affiliates or related entities. While the Commission has been soliciting voluntary reporting of this activity, the situation is of such a serious nature that a more specific program for investigation should be developed and implemented. The Committee directs that the Commission provide a report regarding what action has been taken to comply with this requirement prior to the fiscal year  appropriation hearings."

The Committee has raised the cap on administrative expenses to allow the Farm Credit Administration flexibility to deal with hiring and retention issues. This flexibility would allow the FCA Board to make adjustments to the budget, if warranted by the results of their study of personnel needs. The Committee understands that no additional assessment on member institutions would be necessary, as the agency reserve funds are sufficient to cover the increase."

The Committee directs the Secretary, beginning with presentation of the fiscal year  budget, to provide additional information on programs and activities measured against a baseline of actual spending in fiscal year  and the previous three fiscal years. Any increase or decrease to the funding proposed for fiscal year  should be compared to these years, using both a numeric table and an accompanying descriptive explanation. The Committee directs the Department to include an errata sheet in the Explanatory Notes of any proposed budget authority levels that do not conform to the budget appendix. The Committee directs the Department's attention to the specific changes required of the fiscal year  budget for certain programs within the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. The Explanatory Notes should be assembled with the accounts in the same order as the accounts in the bill. Any additional deviations from this format must be approved in advance by the Committee.    Late Reports.--Reports requested by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees are an important part of the exercise of the Committees' oversight responsibilities. The Committee is concerned about the Department's delinquency in completing these reports. The Committee is also concerned that the delay is due to excessively long reviews, especially in the Office of the Secretary. The reports are due on the dates specified in either the House, Senate, or conference report. Each agency of the Department is directed to comply with the deadlines and to cooperate fully with the Office of Budget and Program Analysis in providing these reports. The Committee reserves the right to call before it any agency that does not submit its report or reports on time.    State Office Collocation.--The Committee continues to direct that any reallocation of resources related to the collocation of State offices scheduled for  and subsequent years is subject to the Committee's reprogramming procedures.

Assessments.--The assessments that the Department charges its agencies for other government- and department-wide activities continue to escalate. Since these assessments are borne by the agencies, and Congress did not specifically provide increases to the agencies for these costs, most of the funding for the increase has come at the expense of programs. The Committee continues to direct the Office of the Chief Financial Officer to scrutinize the need for each activity, to consider its benefit to the mission of each agency, and to limit spending wherever possible."

Aerial Application Research.--The Committee recognizes the importance of the ARS Aerial Application Technology Program. The program conducts innovative research making aerial applications more efficient, effective, and precise. Research for aerial application serves the public good as a vital tool for the future, as agriculture strives to meet the food, fiber, and bio-energy demands of a growing population.    Agriculture Technology Innovation.--The Committee recognizes the importance of the connection between basic research, applied research, and commercialization and encourages ARS to work with growers, industry, and other stakeholders to ensure its technology transfer activities are coordinated to benefit U.S. agriculture.

Domestic and Bighorn Sheep.--The Committee recognizes the challenges caused by infectious disease problems arising from wildlife-domestic animal agriculture interactions, particularly between domestic sheep and wild bighorn sheep. Research has recently produced an experimental vaccine to protect bighorn populations from disease but much work still needs to be done in this area. The Committee encourages ARS to work to determine the role of domestic sheep in causing die-offs of bighorn sheep from respiratory disease and develop methods to reduce transmission and enhance immunity in domestic and bighorn sheep.    Emerging Cereal Rust Diseases.--The Committee continues to be concerned about emerging cereal rust diseases, particularly Ug, and the threat they pose to domestic and world food supplies. The Committee encourages ARS to continue its work on these diseases, including the development of Ug-resistant wheat varieties.    Endophyte Research.--The Committee is aware that cool season grasses in the Pacific Northwest serve a dual function as a source of fiber for livestock and for their bioremediation potential on contaminated soils and supports continued research efforts on these issues.    FOV Race  Cotton Research.--The Committee recognizes the serious threat that fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Vasinfectum (FOV), particularly the strain FOV Race , poses to the U.S. cotton industry. The Committee encourages ARS to continue research efforts to combat FOV Race  and to work with industry and other partners to develop effective control measures to eradicate this disease and prevent its spread nationwide.    Greenhouse Research.--The Committee recognizes that greenhouses can produce crops during any season independent of weather and potentially could help reduce the Federal Government's costs associated with the farm safety net. The Committee encourages ARS to continue research to develop more effective production, environmental management, and pest management systems for greenhouses.    Human Nutrition Research.--The Committee remains concerned about the high rates of obesity in the Nation and believes that research on human nutrition to help prevent childhood obesity and the medical issues related to obesity is important. In addition, there is strong evidence that nutrition plays a vital role in how a person ages. The Committee encourages ARS to continue research relating both to childhood and adult obesity as well as the effect of nutrition on aging.    National Agricultural Library.--The Committee encourages ARS to maintain a focus on agriculture-related legal issues within the National Agricultural Library. The Committee recognizes agriculture-related legal issues are being litigated on an increasingly frequent basis, and that the complexity and scope of these legal issues continues to broaden.    Natural Products Research.--The Committee recognizes the importance of developing natural products for use in agriculture in order to produce more toxicologically and environmentally benign pest management tools and to improve the nutriceutical value of crops.    Office of Pest Management Policy.--The Committee commends the Office of Pest Management Policy for its work providing the Department, other Federal agencies, producers, and others scientifically sound analysis of pest management issues important to agriculture, especially methyl bromide transition and pesticide resistance, and encourages the agency to continue to support this office.    Research on Sediments.--The Committee recognizes the importance of finding solutions to the problems associated with soil erosion, including erosion and sedimentation in stream channels and the loss of nutrients and agricultural chemicals from farm fields.    Horticultural Research and Education.--The Committee recognizes the contributions of the U.S. National Arboretum to horticultural research and public education, as well as the services and  acres of green space it provides to the Washington, D.C., community and to international, national, and regional visitors. The Committee encourages ARS to support these research and educational activities.    Lyme Disease Research.--The Committee recognizes the importance of the ongoing research efforts of the ARS regarding tick-borne illnesses. As the agency continues to build upon its research efforts and protect humans and livestock from tick-borne illnesses, the Committee encourages the ARS, in conjunction with other agencies, to maintain its efforts and consider both the human and economic impacts of Lyme disease on communities in the United States."
1339,112-542 H.txt,    For Research and Education Activities,"    For Research and Education Activities, the Committee provides an appropriation of .    Agriculture and Food Science Facility and Equipment Grants for Insular Areas.--The needs of the land-grant institutions in the insular areas are unique, and upgrading their facilities and equipment involve added cost factors and logistics compared with other institutions on the U.S. mainland. The Committee directs NIFA to review the current state of facilities and equipment at these institutions and report to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees by January , , with its findings and recommendations to meet the identified needs.    Budget Request for Fiscal Year .--For the fiscal year  budget request, the Committee directs the Department to include in the budget funding levels proposed to be allocated to and the expected publication date, scope, and allocation level for each request for awards to be published under () each priority area specified in section (b)() of the Competitive, Special, and Facilities Research Grant Act ( U.S.C. i(b)()); () each research and extension project carried out under section (a) of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of  ( U.S.C. (a)); () each grant awarded under section B(a) of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of  ( U.S.C. b(a)); () each research, education, and extension project carried out under section  of the Research Reform Act of  ( U.S.C. ); and () each research and extension project carried out under section  of the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of  ( U.S.C. ). The term `request for awards' means a funding announcement published by NIFA that provides detailed information on funding opportunities at the Institute, including the purpose, eligibility, restrictions, focus areas, evaluation criteria, regulatory information, and instructions on how to apply for such opportunities.    Policy Research.--The Committee notes that NIFA ignored the clear direction of Congress regarding the review process for awards made through the policy research program and directs the agency to ensure its policies and procedures fully incorporate the direction provided by Congress through authorization and appropriation law for each of its programs.    Priority Research.--The Committee recognizes the broad responsibilities of agricultural research, education, extension, and economics that Congress has given to NIFA. However, it is concerned with the focus of many of its grant programs. Given the current budget constraints, the Committee directs the agency to prioritize funding for the highest quality, peer-reviewed, and relevant plant and animal production and protection research.    Program Consolidation and Streamlining.--The Committee appreciates the agency's efforts and proposals to consolidate and streamline its programs and operations to achieve administrative efficiencies and reduce costs. The Committee concurs with the proposal to consolidate the Resident Instruction and Distance Education Grant Programs for Insular Areas but does not concur with the proposal to consolidate the various pest management programs. The Committee is concerned that the proposal to consolidate the pest management programs was not developed with sufficient input from land-grant universities, grower associations, industry, and other interested parties. The Committee encourages NIFA to continue its efforts, working with all interested parties, to design a broadly supported and effective pest management research, education, and extension program that is responsive to the needs of today and the future.    Unexpended/Unobligated Balances.--In its report accompanying the fiscal year  agriculture appropriations bill, the Committee expressed concern about NIFA's large unexpended/unobligated balances and directed the agency to provide a report on them, including an explanation for its past practices and the agency's plans to improve the management of its appropriation. The report was due September , . The Committee continues to have significant concerns with NIFA's unexpended/unobligated balances and notes its displeasure that its request for information was ignored. The Committee directs the agency to provide this report by August , .    The following table reflects the amount provided by the Committee:"

Microbiological Data Program.--The Committee concurs with the President's fiscal year  budget request to terminate the Microbiological Data Program (MDP) in order for the Agricultural Marketing Service to focus on those activities more closely aligned with the core mission and avoid duplication of other Federal Government activities. While food safety is a vitally important part of successfully marketing produce and other agricultural products, other Federal and State public health agencies are better equipped to perform this function. The termination of the MDP will result in savings of nearly . million as proposed in the budget.    Pesticide Recordkeeping Program.--The Committee also concurs with the Administration on its proposal for the Pesticide Recordkeeping Program (PRP). As noted in the Administration's proposal, ``this program is not central to the core mission of AMS, which is to facilitate the competitive and efficient marketing of agricultural products.'' Twenty-three States and one Territory already conduct their own compliance review programs. AMS's work with the other twenty-seven States and two Territories will allow these States and Territories to make a smooth transition to their own compliance review programs. The termination of the PRP will result in a savings of . million as proposed in the budget.    National Organic Program.--The Committee encourages AMS to continue funding for the National Organic Program at the fiscal year  level.    National Farmers Market Directory.--The Committee commends the Agricultural Market Service for its recent work on the National Farmers Markets Directory.

The Committee recommendation provides the same level of funding as the President's budget request. This funding level assumes the promulgation of a final rule to modernize poultry inspection in the United States by October , . The Committee directs the Under Secretary to notify the Committee not later than September , , on the status of this rule. If the Committee determines at that time that the final rule will not be promulgated by the beginning of fiscal year , the Committee will make a determination on any adjustments to the funding level for the FSIS.    Humane Methods of Slaughter.--As part of meeting the Congressional mandate of  FTEs for humane handling verification activities, FSIS shall ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that the  FTEs using funds appropriated in fiscal year  for the purpose of improving enforcement of the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act are dedicated solely to overseeing compliance with humane handling rules for live animals as they arrive and are offloaded and handled in pens, chutes, and stunning areas.    Poultry inspection.--The Committee supports FSIS's efforts to modernize the poultry inspection system. The Committee strongly recommends that FSIS require plant employees to be trained before assuming inspection responsibilities. The Committee also urges the agency to modify the proposal so that plants that voluntarily transition to this new inspection system can participate in National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health studies on worker safety and line speed."

National Marine Sanctuaries.--The Committee urges the agency to continue the collaborative agreement with the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries to address agricultural sources of runoff, such as sediments, nitrates, and pesticides.    Sage Grouse Initiative.--The Committee supports NRCS's sage grouse conservation efforts. Through the initiative, NRCS provides technical and financial assistance to help landowners conserve sage grouse habitat on their land. The initiative is an integral part of efforts by Federal agencies, several western States, and private landowners to help preclude the listing of the sage grouse as an endangered species.    Wetlands Reserve Program.--The Committee is aware of concerns regarding the Wetlands Reserve Program's (WRP) easement valuation process and how potential WRP easements interact with public drainage systems. The Committee directs NRCS to report to the Committee within  days of enactment of this Act on the regulations and policies governing the program to ensure it is appropriately designed and implemented to avoid the payment above the reasonable value of farmland for easements and to ensure wetland easement conservation plans adequately permit the repair, improvement, and inspection of land that is necessary to maintain existing public drainage systems."

The Committee directs RUS to focus expenditures on projects that bring broadband service to currently unserved households.    Broadband Program.--The Committee is concerned and disappointed with the progress of broadband projects funded under the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act and directs the Department to develop a plan of action to significantly quicken the pace of project review, approval, and completion in managing broadband projects. The Committee also requests the Department to report on how the Federal Communications Commission's Universal Service Fund and Intercarrier Compensation reform and modernization plans are likely to affect Rural Utility Service telecommunications borrowers. The Committee directs that both reports be provided to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate within  days of enactment of this Act."
1382,112-542 H.txt,    For the Office of the Under Secretary for Food,"    For the Office of the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services, the Committee provides an appropriation of .    The Committee directs FNS to continue making all policy documents related to the WIC program (including, but not limited to, instructions, memoranda, guidance, and questions and answers) available to the public on the Internet within one week of their release to State WIC administrators.    The Committee directs USDA to issue guidelines to the appropriate State agencies within  days of enactment of this Act on a requirement to include the USDA Inspector General (IG) Fraud Hotline and the IG website address on all SNAP and WIC Electronic Benefit Transfer cards and WIC coupons or vouchers for the purpose of reporting potential fraud, waste, and abuse by vendors and/or participants.    The Committee is concerned about fraud committed by vendors and retail establishments in the SNAP and WIC programs and the corresponding loss of public tax dollars. Therefore, the Secretary is directed to certify that any newly approved application from a vendor/retailer to participate in WIC or SNAP does not include individuals or entities that have been permanently debarred from participating in either of the programs.    Program Integrity and Identity Theft.--As part of USDA's effort to reduce fraud, ensure the integrity of its feeding programs, and safeguard the identities of participants in nutrition assistance programs, the Committee encourages the Secretary to provide a report on the prevalence of identity theft against nutrition program recipients and the need for identity theft protection educational materials to program providers and recipients.    SNAP Dietary Offerings.--The Committee believes USDA should ensure that SNAP serves as a supplemental nutrition safety net as well as a means for low-income participants to improve their dietary intake. The Committee understands that USDA is conducting research into SNAP purchasing patterns, and requests an update by August , , describing the market research as well as a projected completion date. Upon completion of the market research, USDA shall brief the Committee on its findings and a formal report transmitting the results of the research will be made to this Committee within  days of its completion. Lastly, the Under Secretary is directed to convene a meeting of stakeholders for the purpose of seeking input on ways to improve the diets of SNAP recipients."
1383,112-542 H.txt,    For the Child Nutrition Programs,"    For the Child Nutrition Programs, the Committee provides .    Improper Payments.--As expressly noted during the FNCS appropriations hearing, the Committee continues to be concerned about the improper payment rates in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and National School Breakfast Programs (NSBP). According to GAO, the NSLP is one of four Federal Programs with the highest dollar estimates () and highest error rates ( percent) for improper payments. The NSBP is listed as the second highest improper payment error rate ( percent or an estimated ) for all Federal programs. While FNS and OIG study this issue to determine solutions to lower these improper payment rates, the Committee expects USDA to utilize funds from the State Administrative Expenses account to assist States and Local Educational Agencies in reducing verification errors, duplicate payments, fraud, and/or misrepresentation by program participants.    Prioritization of Monitoring and Compliance Reviews.--The Committee directs the Secretary to allow States to vary the frequency of monitoring and compliance reviews of each school food authority based on past school performance, with no cycle extending more than five years. Congress granted the Secretary this flexibility in the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of . The Committee further directs that no later than the second quarter of fiscal year , and in close consultation with the Nation's governors, USDA must take regulatory action that implements congressional intent and provides States with the ability to vary inspection frequency based on past school performance.    Summer Food Service Pilot Program.--Distressed counties in certain parts of the country face high levels of food insecurity that leave children vulnerable to hunger and decreased school performance. The Committee supports the efforts that authorize the Secretary to conduct demonstrations to test new models of preventing food insecurity and hunger among children during the summer months. The Committee urges the Secretary to cost effectively coordinate with States, non-profits, and other Federal agencies or commissions to replicate the positive outcomes from these models to promote food security in counties as defined in  U.S.C. .    The following table reflects the Committee recommendations for the child nutrition programs:[Dollars in Thousands]Child Nutrition Programs:    School lunch program................................"
1384,112-542 H.txt,    For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,"    For the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), the Committee provides an appropriation of .    The President's budget request includes a projection of an average monthly participation rate of . million women, infants, and children in fiscal year . It is worth noting that the rolling twelve month average of participation declined in every month from June  through December . The average monthly participation for fiscal year  was . million participants. The Committee is unaware of any particular economic indicators or programmatic changes that will cause participation to increase above the . million monthly participants in fiscal year  or .    The Committee will continue to monitor WIC food costs, participation, and carry-over funds and take additional action as necessary to ensure that funding provided in fiscal year  is sufficient to serve all eligible applicants.    The Committee provides for continuation of the breastfeeding peer counselor program and investments in infrastructure and management information systems within the total amount provided in the bill, pending a determination by the Secretary that funds are available to meet caseload demand.    Uniform Income Eligibility Standards.--The Committee is concerned that USDA's regulations regarding income eligibility determinations and corresponding allowable practices, including the definitions of income and household, use of programs acceptable for adjunctive or automatic eligibility, and income verification procedures, have created wide disparity among the States, Territories, and Tribal Organizations. Income definitions, adjunctive eligibility practices, and verification procedures for applicants vary by State or within a State as noted in USDA's April  report entitled ``National Survey of WIC Participants II--Volume .'' WIC agencies use standard tables for Income Eligibility Guidelines, but the way in which income is defined and verified at the local agency can vary substantially. Income eligibility is set by statute at  percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) for households ``of related or non-related individuals who are living together as one economic unit.'' While some State agencies may find administrative savings in the use of adjunctive eligibility, the Committee believes that income is inconsistently measured and verified by local WIC agencies across the country, potentially giving rise to a situation where WIC participants have incomes far in excess of the eligibility standard. The Committee directs FNS to issue instructions to all State agencies by October , , which will ensure income eligibility uniformity across all States, Tribal Organizations, and U.S. Territories.    WIC Food Cost Management.--The Committee supports USDA's efforts to rein in the cost of WIC food items in the State of California and elsewhere, but the Committee is concerned about the wide range of variation in average food costs per participant among the States and expects the Department to do more in this area. The Texas WIC program, which has the second largest percentage of program participants, has maintained the lowest average food cost per participant (.) in the nation, with a  average that was  percent below the national average. Furthermore, adjacent States may have an average food cost per participant that was far below the national average in  (. per participant in New Hampshire) and an average that substantially exceeded the national average (. per participant in Vermont). Federal regulations require that State agencies implement a vendor peer group system, competitive price criteria, and maximum allowable reimbursement levels so that the program only pays competitive prices for foods. As demonstrated in USDA's oversight of the California program, USDA has the ability to intervene and require State agencies to reduce the maximum dollar amount the State agency reimburses for food items. The Committee directs the Department to report to the Committees on Appropriations no later than  days after the date of enactment of this Act on the steps USDA is taking to encourage additional cost-containment practices in the States and/or initiatives to reduce the maximum reimbursement rate where warranted."
1385,112-542 H.txt,    For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),"    For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Committee provides . The total amount includes  for a contingency reserve in fiscal year  and  to be used only in the amount necessary.    Healthy Incentives Pilot Program.--The Committee is interested in USDA's ongoing work to evaluate health and nutrition promotion in the SNAP program to determine if incentives provided to SNAP recipients at the point-of-sale increase the purchase of fruits, vegetables, or other healthful foods. USDA is directed to share those results with the Committee as soon as practicable.    Brand Name Foods/SNAP Retailers.--The Committee is aware of SNAP vendor practices that alert SNAP participants of a retail outlet's approved status to accept SNAP benefits while simultaneously promoting branded products in the materials. The Committee encourages USDA to issue guidance to the States to prevent this type of promotion of any particular food brand.    Prepared Foods/Beverages Purchased with SNAP Benefits.--The Committee is concerned that SNAP vendors are allowed to sell prepared food or drink with SNAP benefits beyond those allowances for the homeless, elderly, or physically disabled. The Committee directs USDA to tighten restrictions on SNAP eligibility for hot prepared foods and extend restrictions to other foods intended for immediate on-premise consumption, such as hot prepared beverages and fountain drinks.    Fraud, Waste, and Abuse.--While SNAP provides a vital food security safety net to over  million people, the Committee is concerned about the dollar level associated with waste, fraud, and abuse in this immense Federal nutrition program. The Committee encourages the Department to go beyond current efforts to make further reductions in fraud and improper payment rates. Total SNAP obligations, including ARRA funds, in FY  are estimated to be . According to USDA's estimates of a one percent fraud rate and a . percent overpayment rate, payments involving fraud and payments in excess of those legitimately due to beneficiaries would total approximately .    Data Sharing.--The Committee urges USDA to require States to share SNAP recipient case data, including the appropriate use of the ALERT database, so USDA may determine whether individuals or households are receiving duplicative benefits in more than one State. To prevent the potential for fraud, the Secretary also is urged to use the FBI National Crime Information Center database as part of the process in determining authorization of SNAP retailers and use its suspension and debarment authority to prevent repeat offenders from re-entering and defrauding SNAP or any other Federal program. The Committee directs USDA to submit a report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations by October , , detailing plans to prevent future fraud and improper payments, including efforts to debar or exclude both vendors and participants from the receipt of benefits if found guilty of fraud or abuse.

TEFAP Handling and Distribution Costs.--In addition to the grant funds to support commodity handling and distribution costs, the bill permits States to use up to  percent of the funds provided for purchasing TEFAP commodities to help with the costs of storing, transporting, and distributing commodities. The Committee expects State agencies to consult with their emergency feeding organizations on the need for the conversion of such funds."

Reconstruction and Stabilization Activities.--The Committee does not include funding for agricultural reconstruction and stabilization activities. While the Committee provides support for developmental projects through P.L. , Title II funds, the Committee believes that reconstruction and stabilization activities should continue to be supported through other existing programs and accounts in the U.S. Government. FAS needs to focus on an enhanced strategic plan and direction for agriculture trade policy and urges the Department to take a more proactive role in developing such a policy.

In addition,"    The Committee provides an appropriation of  in new budget authority for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In addition, the Committee recommends  in animal drug user fees;  in generic animal drug user fees;  in food reinspection user fees;  in food and feed export certification user fees;  in tobacco product user fees, and assumes the reauthorization of prescription drug and medical device user fees for total salaries and expenses of . This total does not include estimates of  for mammography user fees and  for export certification user fees. The Committee notes that generic drug and biosimilars user fees legislation is pending before the authorizing committee and will make adjustments to the provisions in this bill upon enactment of such fees. The estimated fiscal year  collections for these fees are  for generic drugs and  for biosimilars.    The Committee recommendation includes an increase of  above the budget request for FDA food safety;  for food and drug inspections in China; and an increase of  for advancing medical countermeasures. The Committee recommendation includes the proposed savings of  due to data and information technology consolidation, but only attributes  of these savings to the foods program.    The Committee recommendation does not include proposed user fees for food establishment registration, food contact notification, medical product re-inspection, cosmetics, and international courier imports.    Spending Plans.--Within  days from the enactment of this Act, the Commissioner shall notify the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress on the allocation of the funds provided herein by account and within each account by program, project, and activity.    Nutrition Labeling.--The Committee remains concerned with the proposed rule that FDA issued on April , , to regulate Nutrition Labeling of Standard Menu Items at Chain Restaurants. The proposed rule includes establishments that are not primarily in the business of selling food for immediate consumption or selling food that is prepared or processed on the premises. These establishments are not similar to restaurants and should not fall within the definition of the term ``similar retail food establishment''. The Committee urges FDA to use the proposed alternative ``Option '' definition in the rule to mean only restaurants or retail establishments where the primary and majority of business is the selling of food for consumption or the selling of food that is processed or prepared on the premises.    Bacterial Contamination of Blood.--The Committee is aware that bacterial contamination of blood platelets is a risk for blood transfusion recipients. The Committee also is aware of a recent study that showed the vast majority of bacterially contaminated platelets are being missed by culture testing and that bacterial testing of platelets on the day of transfusion using an existing FDA approved technology may be beneficial to some transfusion recipients. The Committee directs FDA to provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress, within  days of enactment of this Act, on the need to make the medical community aware of the safety risks to transfusion patients from bacterially contaminated platelets and to determine what further actions FDA should take to reduce the risk of this type of infection.    Seafood Advisory.--The Committee is concerned that FDA has not published a final seafood advisory as directed in House Report - and Senate Report -. The Committee directs FDA to issue a final seafood advisory consistent with USDA's dietary guidelines by July , . The Committee directs the FDA Commissioner to notify the Committee in writing prior to this date if this directive will not be met and include the reasons for not meeting it.    Prescription Drug Inserts.--The Committee is concerned about an FDA proposal that would eliminate printed inserts for prescription drugs and replace them with a solely electronic system and urges FDA to consider a system that uses an electronic format in addition to paper, rather than in lieu of paper.    Regulations.--The Committee understands that on December , , FDA announced its intention to make cigars subject to Chapter IX of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Committee reminds FDA that premium cigars have unique characteristics and cost prohibitive price points and are not marketed to kids. Any effort to regulate cigars should take these items into consideration.    Global Health.--The Committee recognizes the critical contribution that FDA's global health research, development funding, and leadership in licensing health technologies make to improve global health. The Committee also recognizes the need to sustain and support U.S. investment in this area by providing funding to FDA to carry out this work. The Committee directs FDA to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate, within  days of enactment of this Act, outlining the implementation of the findings and recommendations in the Report to Congress referred to in paragraphs () and () of section (c) of Public Law -. The Committee also urges FDA to make the necessary modifications to include Chagas disease in its list of neglected diseases in line with the World Health Organization list of neglected and tropical diseases.    Pediatric Cancer.--The Committee notes that cancer remains the leading cause of disease-related death in children, that the incidence of childhood cancer is increasing, and that more effective and less toxic treatments are needed. The Committee encourages FDA to collaborate with industry and the pediatric cancer community to promote the development of new therapies.    Tanning Devices.--The March  meeting of the General and Plastic Surgery Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee recommended more accurate classification of tanning devices to save lives. FDA is encouraged to quickly promulgate an interim final rule to reclassify tanning devices.    Centers of Excellence.--The Committee is aware of the important support provided to FDA's food and veterinary medicine programs and through its research and program relations with their centers of excellence. The Committee encourages FDA to maintain an appropriate funding level for both Food Safety Modernization Act related activities and the base work performed by these centers.    Gluten-free Rulemaking.--The Committee is aware of FDA's intention to issue a final rule by the end of  to define gluten-free labeling of foods. The Committee encourages FDA to work with USDA to assist its agencies in adopting the definition of gluten-free set by the FDA final rule to provide uniform labeling requirements and best protect consumers with celiac disease and other conditions.    Antibacterial Resistance.--To assist efforts intended to curb antibacterial resistance, the Committee directs the Secretaries of Agriculture and Health and Human Services to require agencies to: () seek public comment on collecting more detailed sales and distribution data for antibacterial drugs approved for use in food-producing animals, including estimates of the amount sold or distributed in specific animal species; () seek public comment on alternative methods for obtaining additional data and information about the extent of antibacterial drug use in food-producing animals; and () based on input received, work collaboratively to develop a strategy for implementing the best approach. The Committee further directs FDA to ensure that the Agricultural Research Service continues to analyze, characterize, and report on data collected through NARMS.    Mammography Quality Assurance.--The Committee urges FDA to quickly follow up on the November  meeting of the National Mammography Quality Assurance Advisory Committee by promptly reviewing the evidence supporting the inclusion of information related to an individual's breast density in the mammogram lay report and physician report.    Food Safety Rulemaking.--The Committee is aware the Administration missed the January , , statutory deadline for publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking for fresh produce safety standards and final regulations on the content of the Foreign Supplier Verification Program for imported food. The Committee encourages the Administration to meet the statutory timelines for implementing P.L. - and expects FDA to follow a timeline for issuing rulemakings consistent with the sequence and logistics of establishing requirements for a preventive controls framework for domestic and imported foods. The Committee directs FDA to submit a report within  days of enactment of this Act that describes the justification for any proposed rule or final regulation being  days or more beyond the timeline. The Committee further directs FDA to continue to provide such report at the same time that the agency submits its annual budget justification to the Committee.    Pathway to Global Product Safety.--The Committee directs FDA to provide a report by June , , on the implementation of the Pathway to Global Product Safety and Quality initiative.    Dietary Supplements.--The Committee notes that FDA released draft guidance in July  on New Dietary Ingredients (NDI) for Dietary Supplements. Though the Committee wants to ensure that dietary supplements are safe, it is concerned that the draft guidance is being utilized by FDA for enforcement activities against manufacturers despite the guidance only being in draft form, containing nonbinding recommendations, and for comment purposes only. The Committee urges FDA to withdraw the July  NDI draft guidance and re-engage the dietary supplement community to develop a new guidance on what constitutes NDI.    Food Contact Notification.--The Committee directs FDA to maintain the fiscal year  funding level for the Food Contact Notification program.    Nutritional Ratings Systems.--The Committee is concerned about the use of nutritional rating and front of package claims in the marketplace. To promote public health and facilitate consumer understanding, such information should be consistent with the Institute of Medicine's recommendations for front of package nutrition rating systems and symbols and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and based on criteria that are public and readily available to consumers. Further, such systems and symbols should be evaluated by FDA to ensure their usefulness for American consumers, consistency with FDA nutrition programs, and compliance with relevant FDA food labeling requirements. The Committee directs FDA to provide a report regarding its plans to establish guidance for developing such systems and to provide the Committee a timetable for issuing such guidance."

Spending Plans.--Within  days from the enactment of this Act, the Chairman shall notify the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate on the allocation of the funds provided herein by account and within each account by program, project, and activity. The plan should be similar in format to that provided to the Committee for fiscal year .    Financial Management.--The Committee is aware of a Reduction-in-Force (RIF) made by the Commission regarding its Administrative Law Judges program in the latter part of fiscal year . The Commission justified this RIF as a cost-saving measure in excess of . This action not only augmented an existing activity, reduced personnel by more than  percent, and resulted in a general cost savings from personnel reduction but also reorganized an office and eliminated an entire program. The Administrative Law Judges program was an essential function of the Office of Proceedings as authorized by Congress and detailed in the Commission's fiscal year  Budget Request. An in-house, independent judicial review capability is essential for the Commission's core mission. The Commission failed to notify the Committee of this reprogramming, directly violating Section  of P.L. -. The Committee is further concerned that such action may have violated the Anti-Deficiency Act. As a result, the Committee requests the Government Accountability Office investigate this situation, report to the Committees on whether the Commission's action violated these laws, and identify all actions taken or recommended to be taken to address and correct any violation.    Hiring Practices.--The Committee is concerned about the Commission's hiring practices while operating under a Continuing Resolution at the outset of the past two fiscal years. The Committee directs the Commission to refrain from excessive hiring while operating under a Continuing Resolution.    Cost-Benefit Analysis.--The Committee remains concerned about the Commission's lack of strong cost-benefit analyses. In its -year history, not a single lawsuit had been brought against the Commission stemming from its cost-benefit analyses; however, two major lawsuits have recently been filed based on the application of Section (a) of the Commodity Exchange Act. These lawsuits reallocate scarce resources away from the core functions of the Commission. The Committee is encouraged by the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Commission and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) dated May , , allowing technical assistance to be given to the Commission by OIRA staff. The Committee directs the Commission to receive technical assistance in the cost-benefit process from OIRA on all future rulemakings. Further, the Committee is concerned about overlapping provisions and regulations in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and includes bill language to provide a report to the Committees of jurisdiction."
